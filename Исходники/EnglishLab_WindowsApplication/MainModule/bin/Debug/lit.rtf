\par honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed      
\par hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and      
\par now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across        
\par the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the          
\par huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making      
\par him think of those pallid jade-faced painters of Tokio who, through         
\par the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey           
\par the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees            
\par shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling            
\par with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the                
\par straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The      
\par dim roar of London was like the burdon note of a distant organ.             
\par   In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the         
\par full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal               
\par beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the      
\par artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some             
\par years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise        
\par to so many strange conjectures.                                             
\par   As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so           
\par skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his        
\par face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up,         
\par and, closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though          
\par he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which        
\par he feared he might awake.                                                   
\par   "It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,"         
\par said Lord Henry, languidly. "You must certainly send it next year to        
\par the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I          
\par have gone there, there have either been so many people that I have not      
\par been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures      
\par that I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The           
\par Grosvenor is really the only place."                                        
\par   "I don't think I shall send it anywhere," he answered, tossing his        
\par head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him        
\par at Oxford. "No; I won't send it anywhere."                                  
\par   Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows, and looked at him in amazement          
\par through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful      
\par whorls from his heavy opium-tainted cigarette.                              
\par   "Not send it anywhere? My dear fellow, why? Have you any reason?          
\par What odd chaps you painters are! You do anything in the world to            
\par gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to             
\par throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in           
\par the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being              
\par talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above all the          
\par young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men        
\par are ever capable of any emotion."                                           
\par   "I know you will laugh at me," he replied, "but I really can't            
\par exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it."                         
\par   Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.                
\par   "Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same."              
\par   "Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know           
\par you were so vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between            
\par you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this        
\par young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and                  
\par rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you- well,          
\par of course you have an intellectual expression, and all that. But            
\par beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins.          
\par Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the             
\par harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes         
\par all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful      
\par men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are!      
\par Except, of course, in the church. But then in the church they don't         
\par think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was            
\par told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural                 
\par consequence he always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious          
\par young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture          
\par really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is        
\par some brainless, beautiful creature, who should always be here in            
\par winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer        
\par when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don't flatter             
\par yourself, Basil, you are not in the least like him."                        
\par   "You don't understand me, Harry," answered the artist. "Of course         
\par I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be          
\par sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the      
\par truth. There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual              
\par distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history         
\par the faltering steps of kings. It is better not to be different from         
\par one's fellows. The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this          
\par world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play. If they know        
\par nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of               
\par defeat. They live as we all should live, undisturbed, indifferent, and      
\par without disquiet. They neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever             
\par receive it, from alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Harry; my               
\par brains, such as they are- my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian          
\par Gray's good looks- we shall all suffer for what the gods have given         
\par us, suffer terribly."                                                       
\par   "Dorian Gray? Is that his name?" asked Lord Henry, walking across         
\par the studio towards Basil Hallward.                                          
\par   "Yes, that is his name. I didn't intend to tell it to you."               
\par   "But why not?"                                                            
\par   "Oh, I can't explain. When I like people immensely I never tell           
\par their names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have      
\par grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make           
\par modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is          
\par delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my      
\par people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is      
\par a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great            
\par deal of romance into one's life. I suppose you think me awfully             
\par foolish about it?"                                                          
\par   "Not at all," answered Lord Henry, "not at all, my dear Basil. You        
\par seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is          
\par that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both             
\par parties. I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I      
\par am doing. When we meet- we do meet occasionally, when we dine out           
\par together, or go down to the Duke's- we tell each other the most absurd      
\par stories with the most serious faces. My wife is very good at it-            
\par much better, in fact, than I am. She never gets confused over her           
\par dates, and I always do. But when she does find me out, she makes no         
\par row at all. I sometimes wish she would; but she merely laughs at me."       
\par   "I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry," said Basil      
\par Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. "I           
\par believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are           
\par thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary            
\par fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.        
\par Your cynicism is simply a pose."                                            
\par   "Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I           
\par know," cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into      
\par the garden together, and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat         
\par that stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped         
\par over the polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.       
\par   After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. "I am afraid I            
\par must be going, Basil," he murmured, "and before I go, I insist on your      
\par answering a question I put to you some time ago."                           
\par   "What is that?" said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the           
\par ground.                                                                     
\par   "You know quite well."                                                    
\par   "I do not, Harry."                                                        
\par   "Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why        
\par you won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture. I want the real reason."           
\par   "I told you the real reason."                                             
\par   "No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of           
\par yourself in it. Now, that is childish."                                     
\par   "Harry," said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face,           
\par "every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the           
\par artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the           
\par occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather         
\par the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I      
\par will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in      
\par it the secret of my own soul."                                              
\par   Lord Henry laughed. "And what is that?" he asked.                         
\par   "I will tell you," said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity         
\par came over his face.                                                         
\par   "I am all expectation, Basil," continued his companion, glancing          
\par at him.                                                                     
\par   "Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry," answered the            
\par painter; "and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you        
\par will hardly believe it."                                                    
\par   Lord Henry smiled, and, leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled             
\par daisy from the grass, and examined it. "I am quite sure I shall             
\par understand it," he replied, gazing intently at the little golden            
\par white-feathered disk, "and as for believing things, I can believe           
\par anything, provided that it is quite incredible."                            
\par   The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy                
\par lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the          
\par languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a         
\par blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze          
\par wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heart           
\par beating, and wondered what was coming.                                      
\par   "The story is simply this," said the painter after some time. "Two        
\par months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's. You know we poor            
\par artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to        
\par remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and         
\par a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can         
\par gain a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the        
\par room about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and            
\par tedious Academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was         
\par looking at me. I turned halfway round, and saw Dorian Gray for the          
\par first time. When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A            
\par curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I had come            
\par face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating        
\par that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my         
\par whole soul, my very art itself. I did not want any external                 
\par influence in my life. You know yourself, Harry, how independent I am        
\par by nature. I have always been my own master; had at least always            
\par been so, till I met Dorian Gray. Then- but I don't know how to explain      
\par it to you. Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a         
\par terrible crisis in my life. I had a strange feeling that Fate had in        
\par store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid,           
\par and turned to quit the room. It was not conscience that made me do it:      
\par it was a sort of cowardice. I take no credit to myself for trying to        
\par escape."                                                                    
\par   "Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil.              
\par Conscience is the trade-name of the firm. That is all."                     
\par   "I don't believe that, Harry, and I don't believe you do either.          
\par However, whatever was my motive- and it may have been pride, for I          
\par used to be very proud- I certainly struggled to the door. There, of         
\par course, I stumbled against Lady Brandon. 'You are not going to run          
\par away so soon, Mr. Hallward?' she screamed out. You know her                 
\par curiously shrill voice?"                                                    
\par   "Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty," said Lord Henry,        
\par pulling the daisy to bits with his long, nervous fingers.                   
\par   "I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to Royalties, and          
\par people with Stars and Garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras      
\par and parrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only         
\par met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I         
\par believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time,          
\par at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is         
\par the nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found            
\par myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so             
\par strangely stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes        
\par met again. It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to               
\par introduce me to him. Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was      
\par simply inevitable. We would have spoken to each other without any           
\par introduction. I am sure of that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He,          
\par too, felt that we were destined to know each other."                        
\par   "And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?"             
\par asked his companion. "I know she goes in for giving a rapid precis          
\par of all her guests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and         
\par red-faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons,           
\par and hissing into my ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been           
\par perfectly audible to everybody in the room, the most astounding             
\par details. I simply fled. I like to find out people for myself. But Lady      
\par Brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods.        
\par She either explains them entirely away, or tells one everything             
\par about them except what one wants to know."                                  
\par   "Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!" said Hallward,           
\par listlessly.                                                                 
\par   "My dear fellow, she tried to found a salon, and only succeeded in        
\par opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did         
\par she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?"                                             
\par   "Oh, something like 'Charming boy- poor dear mother and I absolutely      
\par inseparable. Quite forget what he does- afraid he- doesn't do               
\par anything- oh, yes, plays the piano- or is it the violin, dear Mr.           
\par Gray?' Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at          
\par once."                                                                      
\par   "Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it          
\par is far the best ending for one," said the young lord, plucking another      
\par daisy.                                                                      
\par   Hallward shook his head. "You don't understand what friendship is,        
\par Harry," he murmured- "or what enmity is, for that matter. You like          
\par every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one."               
\par   "How horribly unjust of you!" cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat           
\par back, and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins        
\par of glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of        
\par the summer sky. "Yes, horribly unjust of you. I make a great                
\par difference between people. I choose my friends for their good looks,        
\par my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their        
\par good intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his           
\par enemies. I have not got one who is a fool, they are all men of some         
\par intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that        
\par very vain of me? I think it is rather vain."                                
\par   "I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must      
\par be merely an acquaintance."                                                 
\par   "My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance."              
\par   "And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?"              
\par   "Oh, brothers! I don't care for brothers. My elder brother won't          
\par die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else."               
\par   "Harry!" exclaimed Hallward, frowning.                                    
\par   "My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can't help                 
\par detesting my relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none          
\par of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves. I         
\par quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what        
\par they call the vices of the upper orders. The masses feel that               
\par drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their own special          
\par property, and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself he is           
\par poaching on their preserves. When poor Southwark got into the               
\par Divorce Court, their indignation was quite magnificent. And yet I           
\par don't suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly."         
\par   "I don't agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is        
\par more, Harry, I feel sure that you don't either."                            
\par   Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard, and tapped the toe of         
\par his patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. "How English           
\par you are, Basil! That is the second time you have made that                  
\par observation. If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman-              
\par always a rash thing to do- he never dreams of considering whether           
\par the idea is right or wrong. The only thing he considers of any              
\par importance is whether one believes it oneself. Now, the value of an         
\par idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who         
\par expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere         
\par the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in            
\par that case it will not be coloured by either his wants, his desires, or      
\par his prejudices. However, I don't propose to discuss politics,               
\par sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons better than              
\par principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything      
\par else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray. How often do         
\par you see him?"                                                               
\par   "Every day. I couldn't be happy if I didn't see him every day. He is      
\par absolutely necessary to me."                                                
\par   "How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything           
\par but your art."                                                              
\par   "He is all my art to me now," said the painter, gravely. "I               
\par sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance      
\par in the world's history. The first is the appearance of a new medium         
\par for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art      
\par also. What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the          
\par face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian        
\par Gray will some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him,        
\par draw from him, sketch from him. Of course I have done all that. But he      
\par is much more to me than a model or a sitter. I won't tell you that I        
\par am dissatisfied with what I have done of him or that his beauty is          
\par such that Art cannot express it. There is nothing that Art cannot           
\par express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian           
\par Gray, is good work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious        
\par way- I wonder will you understand me?- his personality has suggested        
\par to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style.         
\par I see things differently, I think of them differently. I can now            
\par re-create life in a way that was hidden from me before. 'A dream of         
\par form in days of thought:'- who is it who says that? I forget; but it        
\par is what Dorian Gray has been to me. The merely visible presence of          
\par this lad- for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is           
\par really over twenty- his merely visible presence- ah! I wonder can           
\par you realize all that that means? Unconsciously he defines for me the        
\par lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the             
\par passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit            
\par that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body- how much that is! We in        
\par our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that        
\par is vulgar, an ideality that is void. Harry! if you only knew what           
\par Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that landscape of mine, for which        
\par Agnew offered me such a huge price, but which I would not part with?        
\par It is one of the best things I have ever done. And why is it so?            
\par Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me. Some           
\par subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the first time in my        
\par life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for,        
\par and always missed."                                                         
\par   "Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray."                   
\par   Hallward got up from his seat, and walked up and down the garden.         
\par After some time he came back. "Harry," he said, "Dorian Gray is to          
\par me simply a motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see              
\par everything in him. He is never more present in my work than when no         
\par image of him is there. He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new         
\par manner. I find him in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness        
\par and subtleties of certain colours. That is all."                            
\par   "Then why won't you exhibit his portrait?" asked Lord Henry.              
\par   "Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression        
\par of all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have          
\par never cared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never      
\par know anything about it. But the world might guess it; and I will not        
\par bare my soul to their shallow, prying eyes. My heart shall never be         
\par put under their microscope. There is too much of myself in the              
\par thing, Harry- too much of myself!"                                          
\par   "Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful             
\par passion is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many        
\par editions."                                                                  
\par   "I hate them for it," cried Hallward. "An artist should create            
\par beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We      
\par live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form          
\par of autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some           
\par day I will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world         
\par shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray."                                
\par   "I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you. It is          
\par only the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray        
\par very fond of you?"                                                          
\par   The painter considered for a few moments. "He likes me," he answered      
\par after a pause; "I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him                 
\par dreadfully. I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I        
\par know I shall be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to         
\par me, and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and         
\par then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real         
\par delight in giving me pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given            
\par away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to      
\par put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an                
\par ornament for a summer's day."                                               
\par   "Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger," murmured Lord Henry.          
\par "Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think      
\par of, but there is no doubt that Genius lasts longer than Beauty. That        
\par accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate           
\par ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have              
\par something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and           
\par facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly               
\par well-informed man- that is the modern idea. And the mind of the             
\par thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a              
\par bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced             
\par above its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same.          
\par Some day you will look at your friend and he will seem to you to be         
\par a little out of drawing, or you won't like his tone of colour, or           
\par something. You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and            
\par seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you. The next time        
\par he calls, you will be perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a          
\par great pity, for it will alter you. What you have told me is quite a         
\par romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a      
\par romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic."                   
\par   "Harry, don't talk like that. As long as I live, the personality          
\par of Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can't feel what I feel. You            
\par change too often."                                                          
\par   "Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are      
\par faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who        
\par know love's tragedies." And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty           
\par silver case, and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious           
\par and satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There      
\par was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the      
\par ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass          
\par like swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful        
\par other people's emotions were!- much more delightful than their              
\par ideas, it seemed to him. One's own soul, and the passions of one's          
\par friends- those were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to          
\par himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had              
\par missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his           
\par aunt's, he would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and        
\par the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the             
\par poor, and the necessity for model lodging-houses. Each class would          
\par have preached the importance of those virtues, for whose exercise           
\par there was no necessity in their own lives. The rich would have              
\par spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown eloquent over the         
\par dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped all that! As he          
\par thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He turned to             
\par Hallward, and said, "My dear fellow, I have just remembered."               
\par   "Remembered what, Harry?"                                                 
\par   "Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray."                                  
\par   "Where was it?" asked Hallward, with a slight frown.                      
\par   "Don't look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha's. She        
\par told me she had discovered a wonderful young man, who was going to          
\par help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am           
\par bound to state that she never told me he was good-looking. Women            
\par have no appreciation of good looks; at least, good women have not. She      
\par said that he was very earnest, and had a beautiful nature. I at once        
\par pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair,                
\par horribly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet. I wish I had known      
\par it was your friend."                                                        
\par   "I am very glad you didn't, Harry."                                       
\par   "Why?"                                                                    
\par   "I don't want you to meet him."                                           
\par   "You don't want me to meet him?"                                          
\par   "No."                                                                     
\par   "Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir," said the butler, coming          
\par into the garden.                                                            
\par   "You must introduce me now," cried Lord Henry, laughing.                  
\par   The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the              
\par sunlight. "Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few             
\par moments." The man bowed, and went up the walk.                              
\par   Then he looked at Lord Henry. "Dorian Gray is my dearest friend," he      
\par said. "He has a simple and beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite right      
\par in what she said of him. Don't spoil him. Don't try to influence            
\par him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many           
\par marvellous people in it. Don't take away from me the one person who         
\par gives to my art whatever charm it possesses; my life as an artist           
\par depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you." He spoke very slowly, and        
\par the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.                  
\par   "What nonsense you talk!" said Lord Henry, smiling, and, taking           
\par Hallward by the arm, he almost led him into the house.                      
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                               CHAPTER II                                    
\par -                                                                           
\par   As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano,         
\par with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of                
\par Schumann's "Forest Scenes." "You must lend me these, Basil," he cried.      
\par "I want to learn them. They are perfectly charming."                        
\par   "That depends entirely on how you sit to-day, Dorian."                    
\par   "Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don't want a life-sized portrait        
\par of myself," answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool, in         
\par a wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint      
\par blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. "I beg your      
\par pardon, Basil, but I didn't know you had any one with you."                 
\par   "This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine.         
\par I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now        
\par you have spoiled everything."                                               
\par   "You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray," said         
\par Lord Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. "My aunt has           
\par often spoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am      
\par afraid, one of her victims, also."                                          
\par   "I am in Lady Agatha's black books at present," answered Dorian,          
\par with a funny look of penitence. "I promised to go to a club in              
\par Whitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it.        
\par We were to have played a duet together- three duets, I believe. I           
\par don't know what she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call."       
\par   "Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to         
\par you. And I don't think it really matters about your not being there.        
\par The audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits          
\par down to the piano she makes quite enough noise for two people."             
\par   "That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me," answered           
\par Dorian, laughing.                                                           
\par   Lord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully               
\par handsome, with his finely-curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes,         
\par his crisp gold hair. There was something in his face that made one          
\par trust him at once. All the candour of youth was there, as well as           
\par all youth's passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself            
\par unspotted from the world. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.          
\par   "You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray- far too        
\par charming." And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan, and              
\par opened his cigarette-case.                                                  
\par   The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes      
\par ready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry's last          
\par remark he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,            
\par "Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it            
\par awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?"                              
\par   Lord Henry smiled, and looked at Dorian Gray. "Am I to go, Mr.            
\par Gray?" he asked.                                                            
\par   "Oh, please don't, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his          
\par sulky moods; and I can't bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you        
\par to tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy."                        
\par   "I don't know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious      
\par a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I             
\par certainly shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop.           
\par You don't really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that           
\par you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to."                        
\par   Hallward bit his lip. "If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.      
\par Dorian's whims are laws to everybody, except himself."                      
\par   Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves. "You are very pressing,            
\par Basil, but I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the      
\par Orleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in              
\par Curzon Street. I am nearly always at home at five o'clock. Write to me      
\par when you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you."                        
\par   "Basil," cried Dorian Gray, "if Lord Henry Wotton goes I shall go         
\par too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is             
\par horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant.           
\par Ask him to stay. I insist upon it."                                         
\par   "Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me," said Hallward,         
\par gazing intently at his picture. "It is quite true, I never talk when I      
\par am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious      
\par for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay."                             
\par   "But what about my man at the Orleans?"                                   
\par   The painter laughed. "I don't think there will be any difficulty          
\par about that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the           
\par platform, and don't move about too much, or pay any attention to            
\par what Lord Henry says. He has a very bad influence over all his              
\par friends, with the single exception of myself."                              
\par   Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais, with the air of a young Greek         
\par martyr, and made a little moue of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he      
\par had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a               
\par delightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few         
\par moments he said to him, "Have you really a very bad influence, Lord         
\par Henry? As bad as Basil says?"                                               
\par   "There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence      
\par is immoral- immoral from the scientific point of view."                     
\par   "Why?"                                                                    
\par   "Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He          
\par does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural               
\par passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such      
\par things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's         
\par music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim        
\par of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly- that        
\par is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves,            
\par nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that      
\par one owes to one's self. Of course they are charitable. They feed the        
\par hungry, and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are          
\par naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had        
\par it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of      
\par God, which is the secret of religion- these are the two things that         
\par govern us. And yet--"                                                       
\par   "Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good      
\par boy," said the painter, deep in his work, and conscious only that a         
\par look had come into the lad's face that he had never seen there before.      
\par   "And yet," continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with      
\par that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of         
\par him, and that he had even in his Eton days, "I believe that if one man      
\par were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to        
\par every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-         
\par I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that        
\par we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the         
\par Hellenic ideal- to something finer, richer, than the Hellenic ideal,        
\par it may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The         
\par mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial         
\par that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse        
\par that we strive to strangle broods in the mind, and poisons us. The          
\par body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of          
\par purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,      
\par or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation          
\par is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing         
\par for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its         
\par monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that      
\par the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the         
\par brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place      
\par also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your        
\par rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,        
\par thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping          
\par dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame-"                
\par   "Stop!" faltered Dorian Gray, "stop! you bewilder me. I don't know        
\par what to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it.             
\par Don't speak. Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think."            
\par   For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips,      
\par and eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely             
\par fresh influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to         
\par have come really from himself. The few words that Basil's friend had        
\par said to him- words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox      
\par in them- had touched some secret chord that had never been touched          
\par before, but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious         
\par pulses.                                                                     
\par   Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many              
\par times. But music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but            
\par rather another chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How         
\par terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel. One could not          
\par escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them.            
\par They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things,           
\par and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of             
\par lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?                      
\par   Yes, there had been things in his boyhood that he had not                 
\par understood. He understood them now. Life suddenly had become                
\par fiery-coloured to him. It seemed to him that he had been walking in         
\par fire. Why had he not known it?                                              
\par   With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise        
\par psychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely                 
\par interested. He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words           
\par had produced, and, remembering a book that he had read when he was          
\par sixteen, a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known        
\par before, he wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a               
\par similar experience. He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it        
\par hit the mark? How fascinating the lad was!                                  
\par   Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that        
\par had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate,      
\par comes only from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.                
\par   "Basil, I am tired of standing," cried Dorian Gray, suddenly. "I          
\par must go out and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here."               
\par   "My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can't think of      
\par anything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And      
\par I have caught the effect I wanted- the half-parted lips and the bright      
\par look in the eyes. I don't know what Harry has been saying to you,           
\par but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I         
\par suppose he has been paying you compliments. You mustn't believe a word      
\par that he says."                                                              
\par   "He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is         
\par the reason that I don't believe anything he has told me."                   
\par   "You know you believe it all," said Lord Henry, looking at him            
\par with his dreamy, languorous eyes. "I will go out to the garden with         
\par you. It is horribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something         
\par iced to drink, something with strawberries in it."                          
\par   "Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will      
\par tell him what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I         
\par will join you later on. Don't keep Dorian too long. I have never            
\par been in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be      
\par my masterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands."                         
\par   Lord Henry went out to the garden, and found Dorian Gray burying his      
\par face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their         
\par perfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him, and put his hand      
\par upon his shoulder. "You are quite right to do that," he murmured.           
\par "Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure         
\par the senses but the soul."                                                   
\par   The lad started and drew back. He was bare-headed, and the leaves         
\par had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded                
\par threads. There was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have          
\par when they are suddenly awakened. His finely-chiselled nostrils              
\par quivered, and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left      
\par them trembling.                                                             
\par   "Yes," continued Lord Henry, "that is one of the great secrets of         
\par life- to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means      
\par of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you           
\par think you know, just as you know less than you want to know."               
\par   Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help           
\par liking the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His            
\par romantic olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There      
\par was something in his low, languid voice that was absolutely                 
\par fascinating. His cool, white, flower-like hands, even, had a curious        
\par charm. They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a            
\par language of their own. But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being      
\par afraid. Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to                
\par himself? He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship         
\par between them had never altered him. Suddenly there had come some one        
\par across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life's mystery.         
\par And, yet, what was there to be afraid of? He was not a schoolboy or         
\par a girl. It was absurd to be frightened.                                     
\par   "Let us go and sit in the shade," said Lord Henry. "Parker has            
\par brought out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare you        
\par will be quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You            
\par really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be              
\par unbecoming."                                                                
\par   "What can it matter?" cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on      
\par the seat at the end of the garden.                                          
\par   "It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray."                           
\par   "Why?"                                                                    
\par   "Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one         
\par thing worth having."                                                        
\par   "I don't feel that, Lord Henry."                                          
\par   "No, you don't feel it now. Some day, when you are old and                
\par wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its           
\par lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you            
\par will feel it, you will feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you          
\par charm the world. Will it always be so?... You have a wonderfully            
\par beautiful face, Mr. Gray. Don't frown. You have. And Beauty is a            
\par form of Genius- is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no              
\par explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight,          
\par or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver             
\par shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned. It has its divine          
\par right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it. You            
\par smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won't smile.... People say             
\par sometimes that Beauty is only superficial. That may be so. But at           
\par least it is not so superficial as Thought is. To me, Beauty is the          
\par wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by            
\par appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the          
\par invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But            
\par what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years        
\par in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes,        
\par your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover            
\par that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself        
\par with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more        
\par bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to           
\par something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your           
\par lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and      
\par dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while        
\par you have it. Don't squander the gold of your days, listening to the         
\par tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your        
\par life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly      
\par aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that      
\par is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new        
\par sensations. Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism- that is what           
\par our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your               
\par personality there is nothing you could not do. The world belongs to         
\par you for a season.... The moment I met you I saw that you were quite         
\par unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be. There      
\par was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you              
\par something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were      
\par wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last-          
\par such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom        
\par again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now. In a          
\par month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after            
\par year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. But          
\par we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at           
\par twenty, becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We                
\par degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions      
\par of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that        
\par we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth! There is                  
\par absolutely nothing in the world but youth!"                                 
\par   Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac         
\par fell from his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed             
\par round it for a moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval          
\par stellated globe of its tiny blossoms. He watched it with that               
\par strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when              
\par things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some        
\par new emotion for which we cannot find expression, or when some               
\par thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls          
\par on us to yield. After a time the bee flew away. He saw it creeping          
\par into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian convolvulus. The flower seemed to      
\par quiver, and then swayed gently to and fro.                                  
\par   Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio, and made         
\par staccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other, and          
\par smiled.                                                                     
\par   "I am waiting," he cried. "Do come in. The light is quite perfect,        
\par and you can bring your drinks."                                             
\par   They rose up, and sauntered down the walk together. Two                   
\par green-and-white butterflies fluttered past them, and in the                 
\par pear-tree at the corner of the garden a thrush began to sing.               
\par   "You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray," said Lord Henry, looking        
\par at him.                                                                     
\par   "Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?"                    
\par   "Always! that is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear         
\par it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by              
\par trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word, too. The          
\par only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that           
\par the caprice lasts a little longer."                                         
\par   As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord            
\par Henry's arm. "In that case, let our friendship be a caprice," he            
\par murmured, flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the              
\par platform and resumed his pose.                                              
\par   Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched        
\par him. The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound      
\par that broke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward               
\par stepped back to look at his work from a distance. In the slanting           
\par beams that streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was        
\par golden. The heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.       
\par   After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked        
\par for a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the             
\par picture, biting the end of one of his huge brushes, and frowning.           
\par "It is quite finished," he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote        
\par his name in long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the           
\par canvas.                                                                     
\par   Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a         
\par wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.                    
\par   "My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly," he said. "It is         
\par the finest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at        
\par yourself."                                                                  
\par   The lad started, as if awakened from some dream. "Is it really            
\par finished?" he murmured, stepping down from the platform.                    
\par   "Quite  finished," said the painter. "And you have sat splendidly         
\par to-day. I am awfully obliged to you."                                       
\par   "That is entirely due to me," broke in Lord Henry. "Isn't it, Mr.         
\par Gray?"                                                                      
\par   Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture      
\par and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks          
\par flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his             
\par eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood          
\par there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was           
\par speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The             
\par sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never         
\par felt it before. Basil Hallward's compliments had seemed to him to be        
\par merely the charming exaggerations of friendship. He had listened to         
\par them, laughed at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his          
\par nature. Then had come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric          
\par on youth, his terrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him at      
\par the time, and now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own              
\par loveliness, the full reality of the description flashed across him.         
\par Yes, there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizened,      
\par his eyes dim and colourless, the grace of his figure broken and             
\par deformed. The scarlet would pass away from his lips, and the gold           
\par steal from his hair. The life that was to make his soul would mar           
\par his body. He would become dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.                   
\par   As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like         
\par a knife, and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes        
\par deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He            
\par felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.                      
\par   "Don't you like it?" cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the        
\par lad's silence, not understanding what it meant.                             
\par   "Of course he likes it," said Lord Henry. "Who wouldn't like it?          
\par It is one of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you             
\par anything you like to ask for it. I must have it."                           
\par   "It is not my property, Harry."                                           
\par   "Whose property is it?"                                                   
\par   "Dorian's, of course," answered the painter.                              
\par   "He is a very lucky fellow."                                              
\par   "How sad it is!" murmured Dorian Gray, with his eyes still fixed          
\par upon his own portrait. "How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible,      
\par and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never      
\par be older than this particular day of June.... If it were only the           
\par other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture         
\par that was to grow old! For that- for that- I would give everything!          
\par Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would          
\par give my soul for that!"                                                     
\par   "You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil," cried Lord        
\par Henry, laughing. "It would be rather hard lines on your work."              
\par   "I should object very strongly, Harry," said Hallward.                    
\par   Dorian Gray turned and looked at him. "I believe you would, Basil.        
\par You like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a      
\par green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say."                           
\par   The painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak         
\par like that. What had happened? He seemed quite angry. His face was           
\par flushed and his cheeks burning.                                             
\par   "Yes," he continued, "I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or          
\par your silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like         
\par me? Till I have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when         
\par one loses one's good looks, whatever they may be, one loses                 
\par everything. Your picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is           
\par perfectly, right. Youth is the only thing worth having. When I find         
\par that I am growing old, I shall kill myself."                                
\par   Hallward turned pale, and caught his hand. "Dorian! Dorian!" he           
\par cried, "don't talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you,        
\par and I shall never have such another. You are not jealous of material        
\par things, are you?- you who are finer than any of them!"                      
\par   "I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am               
\par jealous of the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep          
\par what I must lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me,         
\par and gives something to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the        
\par picture could change. and I could be always what I am now! Why did you      
\par paint it? It will mock me some day- mock me horribly!" The hot tears        
\par welled into his eyes; he tore his hand away, and, flinging himself          
\par on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was          
\par praying.                                                                    
\par   "This is your doing, Harry," said the painter, bitterly.                  
\par   Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. "It is the real Dorian Gray- that      
\par is all."                                                                    
\par   "It is not."                                                              
\par   "If it is not, what have I to do with it?"                                
\par   "You should have gone away when I asked you," he muttered.                
\par   "I stayed when you asked me," was Lord Henry's answer.                    
\par   "Harry, I can't quarrel with my two best friends at once, but             
\par between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have      
\par ever done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour?         
\par I will not let it come across our three lives and mar them."                
\par   Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with              
\par pallid face and tear-stained eyes looked at him, as he walked over          
\par to the deal painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained          
\par window. What was he doing there? His fingers were straying about among      
\par the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes,        
\par it was for the long palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel.      
\par He had found it at last. He was going to rip up the canvas.                 
\par   With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing            
\par over to Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to           
\par the end of the studio. "Don't, Basil, don't!" he cried. "It would be        
\par murder!"                                                                    
\par   "I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian," said the              
\par painter, coldly, when he had recovered from his surprise. "I never          
\par thought you would."                                                         
\par   "Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I      
\par feel that."                                                                 
\par   "Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed,        
\par and sent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself." And he         
\par walked across the room and rang the bell for tea. "You will have            
\par tea, of course, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to         
\par such simple pleasures?"                                                     
\par   "I adore simple pleasures," said Lord Henry. "They are the last           
\par refuge of the complex. But I don't like scenes, except on the stage.        
\par What absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was               
\par defined man as a rational animal. It was the most premature definition      
\par ever given. Man is many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he        
\par is not, after all: though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the      
\par picture. You had much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy          
\par doesn't really want it, and I really do."                                   
\par   "If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive          
\par you!" cried Dorian Gray; "and I don't allow people to call me a             
\par silly boy."                                                                 
\par   "You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it        
\par existed."                                                                   
\par   "And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you        
\par don't really object to being reminded that you are extremely young."        
\par   "I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry."          
\par   "Ah! this morning! You have lived since then."                            
\par   There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a             
\par laden tea-tray, and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was      
\par a rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.      
\par Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray        
\par went over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to        
\par the table, and examined what was under the covers.                          
\par   "Let us go to the theatre to-night," said Lord Henry. "There is sure      
\par to be something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White's, but      
\par it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that         
\par I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a            
\par subsequent engagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse:          
\par it would have all the surprise of candour."                                 
\par   "It is such a bore putting on one's dress-clothes," muttered              
\par Hallward. "And, when one has them on, they are so horrid."                  
\par   "Yes," answered Lord Henry, dreamily, "the costume of the nineteenth      
\par century is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the only      
\par real colour-element left in modern life."                                   
\par   "You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry."          
\par   "Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or           
\par the one in the picture?"                                                    
\par   "Before either."                                                          
\par   "I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry," said         
\par the lad.                                                                    
\par   "Then you shall come; and you will come too, Basil, won't you?"           
\par   "I can't really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do."         
\par   "Well, then, you and I will go, Mr. Gray."                                
\par   "I should like that awfully."                                             
\par   The painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the              
\par picture. "I shall stay with the real Dorian," he said, sadly.               
\par   "Is it the real Dorian?" cried the original of the portrait,              
\par strolling across to him. "Am I really like that?"                           
\par   "Yes; you are just like that."                                            
\par   "How wonderful, Basil!"                                                   
\par   "At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter,"        
\par sighed Hallward. "That is something."                                       
\par   "What a fuss people make about fidelity!" exclaimed Lord Henry.           
\par "Why, even in love it is purely a question of physiology. It has            
\par nothing to do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and         
\par are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can      
\par say."                                                                       
\par   "Don't go to the theatre to-night, Dorian," said Hallward. "Stop and      
\par dine with me."                                                              
\par   "I can't, Basil."                                                         
\par   "Why?"                                                                    
\par   "Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him."               
\par   "He won't like you any better for keeping your promises. He always        
\par breaks his own. I beg you not to go."                                       
\par   Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.                                   
\par   "I entreat you."                                                          
\par   The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching        
\par them from the tea-table with an amused smile.                               
\par   "I must go, Basil," he answered.                                          
\par   "Very well," said Hallward; and he went over and laid down his cup        
\par on the tray. "It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had         
\par better lose no time. Good-bye, Harry. Good-bye, Dorian. Come and see        
\par me soon. Come to-morrow."                                                   
\par   "Certainly."

\par   "No, of course not," cried Dorian.                                        
\par   "And... Harry!"                                                           
\par   "Yes, Basil?"                                                             
\par   "Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this               
\par morning?"                                                                   
\par   "I have forgotten it."                                                    
\par   "I trust you."                                                            
\par   "I wish I could trust myself," said Lord Henry, laughing. "Come, Mr.      
\par Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.           
\par Good-bye, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon."                 
\par   As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on         
\par a sofa, and a look of pain came into his face.                              
\par

\par                              CHAPTER III                                    
\par -                                                                           
\par   At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from              
\par Curzon Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor,         
\par a genial if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside          
\par world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit from          
\par him, but who was considered generous by Society as he fed the people        
\par who amused him. His father had been our ambassador at Madrid when           
\par Isabella was young, and Prim unthought of, but had retired from the         
\par Diplomatic Service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not being         
\par offered the Embassy at Paris, a post to which he considered that he         
\par was fully entitled by reason of his birth, his indolence, the good          
\par English of his despatches, and his inordinate passion for pleasure.         
\par The son, who had been his father's secretary, had resigned along            
\par with his chief, somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time, and          
\par on succeeding some months later to the title, had set himself to the        
\par serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely             
\par nothing. He had two large town houses, but preferred to live in             
\par chambers as it was less trouble, and took most of his meals at his          
\par club. He paid some attention to the management of his collieries in         
\par the Midland counties, excusing himself for this taint of industry on        
\par the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a      
\par gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth.          
\par In politics he was a Tory, except when the Tories were in office,           
\par during which period he roundly abused them for being a pack of              
\par Radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who bullied him, and a terror to      
\par most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn. Only England could          
\par have produced him, and he always said that the country was going to         
\par the dogs. His principles were out of date, but there was a good deal        
\par to be said for his prejudices.                                              
\par   When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a         
\par rough shooting coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over The Times.        
\par "Well, Harry," said the old gentleman, "what brings you out so              
\par early? I thought you dandies never got up until two, and were not           
\par visible until five."                                                        
\par   "Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to get         
\par something out of you."                                                      
\par   "Money, I suppose," said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. "Well,           
\par sit down and tell me all about it. Young people, nowadays, imagine          
\par that money is everything."                                                  
\par   "Yes," murmured Lord Henry, settling his buttonhole in his coat;          
\par "and when they grow older they know it. But I don't want money. It          
\par is only people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and         
\par I never pay mine. Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one           
\par lives charmingly upon it. Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor's            
\par tradesmen, and consequently they never bother me. What I want is            
\par information; not useful information, of course; useless information."       
\par   "Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue-book,           
\par Harry, although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. When I      
\par was in the Diplomatic, things were much better. But I hear they let         
\par them in now by examination. What can you expect? Examinations, sir,         
\par are pure humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman, he          
\par knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is      
\par bad for him."                                                               
\par   "Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue-books, Uncle George,"            
\par said Lord Henry, languidly.                                                 
\par   "Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he?" asked Lord Fermor, knitting his             
\par bushy white eyebrows.                                                       
\par   "That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I            
\par know who, he is. He is the last Lord Kelso's grandson. His mother           
\par was a Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereux. I want you to tell me about         
\par his mother. What was she like? Whom did she marry? You have known           
\par nearly everybody in your time, so you might have known her. I am            
\par very much interested in Mr. Gray at present. I have only just met           
\par him."                                                                       
\par   "Kelso's grandson!" echoed the old gentleman. "Kelso's                    
\par grandson!... Of course.... I knew his mother intimately. I believe I        
\par was at her christening. She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl,          
\par Margaret Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a      
\par penniless young fellow, a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot           
\par regiment, or something of that kind. Certainly. I remember the whole        
\par thing as if it happened yesterday. The poor chap was killed in a            
\par duel at Spa a few months after the marriage. There was an ugly story        
\par about it. They said Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian        
\par brute, to insult his son-in-law in public, paid him, sir, to do it,         
\par paid him, and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a           
\par pigeon. The thing was hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone        
\par at the club for some time afterwards. He brought his daughter back          
\par with him, I was told, and she never spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it         
\par was a bad business. The girl died too, died within a year. So she left      
\par a son, did she? I had forgotten that. What sort of a boy is he? If          
\par he is like his mother he must be a good-looking chap."                      
\par   "He is very good-looking," assented Lord Henry.                           
\par   "I hope he will fall into proper hands," continued the old man.           
\par "He should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the             
\par right thing by him. His mother had money too. All the Selby property        
\par came to her, through her grandfather. Her grandfather hated Kelso,          
\par thought him a mean dog. He was, too. Came to Madrid once when I was         
\par there. Egad, I was ashamed of him. The Queen used to ask me about           
\par the English noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about          
\par their fares. They made quite a story of it. I didn't dare show my face      
\par at Court for a month. I hope he treated his grandson better than he         
\par did the jarvies."                                                           
\par   "I don't know," answered Lord Henry. "I fancy that the boy will be        
\par well off. He is not of age yet. He has Selby, I know. He told me so.        
\par And... his mother was very beautiful?"                                      
\par   "Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw,         
\par Harry. What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could        
\par understand. She could have married anybody she chose. Carlington was        
\par mad after her. She was romantic though. All the women of that family        
\par were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful.         
\par Carlington went on his knees to her. Told me so himself. She laughed        
\par at him, and there wasn't a girl in London at the time who wasn't after      
\par him. And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is          
\par this humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an         
\par American? Ain't English girls good enough for him?"                         
\par   "It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle              
\par George."                                                                    
\par   "I'll back English women against the world, Harry," said Lord             
\par Fermor, striking the table with his fist.                                   
\par   "The betting is on the Americans."                                        
\par   "They don't last, I am told," muttered his uncle.                         
\par   "A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a               
\par steeplechase. They take things flying. I don't think Dartmoor has a         
\par chance."                                                                    
\par   "Who are her people?" grumbled the old gentleman. "Has she got any?"      
\par   Lord Henry shook his head. "American girls are as clever at               
\par concealing their parents, as English women are at concealing their          
\par past," he said, rising to go.                                               
\par   "They are pork-packers, I suppose?"                                       
\par   "I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor's sake. I am told that             
\par pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after             
\par politics."                                                                  
\par   "Is she pretty?"                                                          
\par   "She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It          
\par is the secret of their charm."                                              
\par   "Why can't these American women stay in their own country? They           
\par are always telling us that it is the Paradise for women."                   
\par   "It is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively         
\par anxious to get out of it," said Lord Henry. "Good-bye, Uncle George. I      
\par shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer. Thanks for giving me         
\par the information I wanted. I always like to know everything about my         
\par new friends, and nothing about my old ones."                                
\par   "Where are you lunching, Harry?"                                          
\par   "At Aunt Agatha's. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray. He is her            
\par latest protege."                                                            
\par   "Humph! Tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me with any more      
\par of her charity appeals. I am sick of them. Why, the good woman              
\par thinks that I have nothing to do but write cheques for her silly            
\par fads."                                                                      
\par   "All right, Uncle George, I'll tell her, but it won't have any            
\par effect. Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is their        
\par distinguishing characteristic."                                             
\par   The old gentleman growled approvingly, and rang the bell for his          
\par servant. Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street,        
\par and turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.                   
\par   So that was the story of Dorian Gray's parentage. Crudely as it           
\par had been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a         
\par strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything        
\par for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a             
\par hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a           
\par child born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to      
\par solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an         
\par interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect as          
\par it were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was               
\par something tragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower      
\par might blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night             
\par before, as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure        
\par he had sat opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades                
\par staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking          
\par to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every      
\par touch and thrill of the bow.... There was something terribly                
\par enthralling in the exercise of influence. No other activity was like        
\par it. To project one's soul into some gracious form, and let it tarry         
\par there for a moment; to hear one's own intellectual views echoed back        
\par to one with all the added music of passion and youth; to convey             
\par one's temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a        
\par strange perfume: there was a real joy in that- perhaps the most             
\par satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our            
\par own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common in its      
\par aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad, whom by so curious a      
\par chance he had met in Basil's studio, or could be fashioned into a           
\par marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the white purity of        
\par boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles have kept for us.             
\par There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made a        
\par Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to         
\par fade!... And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how                 
\par interesting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking        
\par at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of           
\par one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim      
\par woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself,        
\par Dryad-like and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her           
\par there had been awakened that wonderful vision to which alone are            
\par wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things           
\par becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value,      
\par as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect      
\par form whose shadow they made real: how strange it all was! He                
\par remembered something like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist      
\par in thought, who had first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had        
\par carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own      
\par country it was strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray           
\par what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned      
\par the wonderful portrait. He would seek to dominate him- had already,         
\par indeed, half done so. He would make that wonderful spirit his own.          
\par There was something fascinating in this son of Love and Death.              
\par   Suddenly he stopped, and glanced up at the houses. He found that          
\par he had passed his aunt's some distance, and smiling to himself, turned      
\par back. When he entered the somewhat sombre hall the butler told him          
\par that they had gone in to lunch. He gave one of the footmen his hat and      
\par stick and passed into the dining-room.                                      
\par   "Late as usual, Harry," cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.          
\par   He invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next        
\par to her, looked round to see who was there. Dorian bowed to him shyly        
\par from the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his            
\par cheek. Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable              
\par good-nature and good temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and      
\par of those ample architectural proportions that in women who are not          
\par Duchesses are described by contemporary historians as stoutness.            
\par Next to her sat, on her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member          
\par of Parliament, who followed his leader in public life and in private        
\par life followed the best cooks, dining with the Tories, and thinking          
\par with the Liberals, in accordance with a wise and well-known rule.           
\par The post on her left was occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old        
\par gentleman of considerable charm and culture, who had fallen,                
\par however, into bad habits of silence, having, as he explained once to        
\par Lady Agatha, said everything that he had to say before he was               
\par thirty. His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur, one of his aunt's oldest      
\par friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so dreadfully dowdy that        
\par she reminded one of a badly bound hymn book. Fortunately for him she        
\par had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most intelligent middle-aged           
\par mediocrity, as bad as a Ministerial statement in the House of Commons,      
\par with whom she was conversing in that intensely earnest manner which is      
\par the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once himself, that all           
\par really good people fall into, and from which none of them ever quite        
\par escape.                                                                     
\par   "We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry," cried the Duchess,      
\par nodding pleasantly to him across the table. "Do you think he will           
\par really marry this fascinating young person?"                                
\par   "I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess."          
\par   "How dreadful!" exclaimed Lady Agatha. "Really, some one should           
\par interfere."                                                                 
\par   "I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an              
\par American dry-goods store," said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking                  
\par supercilious.                                                               
\par   "My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas."                
\par   "Dry-goods! What are American dry-goods?" asked the Duchess, raising      
\par her large hands in wonder, and accentuating the verb.                       
\par   "American novels," answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some           
\par quail.                                                                      
\par   The Duchess looked puzzled.                                               
\par   "Don't mind him, my dear," whispered Lady Agatha. "He never means         
\par anything that he says."                                                     
\par   "When America was discovered," said the Radical member, and he began      
\par to give some wearisome facts. Like all people who try to exhaust a          
\par subject, he exhausted his listeners. The Duchess sighed, and exercised      
\par her privilege of interruption. "I wish to goodness it never had been        
\par discovered at all!" she exclaimed. "Really, our girls have no chance        
\par nowadays. It is most unfair."                                               
\par   "Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered," said Mr.         
\par Erskine; "I myself would say that it had merely been detected."             
\par   "Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants," answered the          
\par Duchess, vaguely. "I must confess that most of them are extremely           
\par pretty. And they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in Paris.      
\par I wish I could afford to do the same."                                      
\par   "They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris," chuckled        
\par Sir Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour's cast-off clothes.          
\par   "Really! And where do bad Americans go when they die?" inquired           
\par the Duchess.                                                                
\par   "They go to America," murmured Lord Henry.                                
\par   Sir Thomas frowned. "I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced           
\par against that great country," he said to Lady Agatha. "I have travelled      
\par all over it, in cars provided by the directors, who, in such                
\par matters, are extremely civil. I assure you that it is an education          
\par to visit it."                                                               
\par   "But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?" asked           
\par Mr. Erskine, plaintively. "I don't feel up to the journey."                 
\par   Sir Thomas waved his hand. "Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on      
\par his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about         
\par them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are           
\par absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing                 
\par characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I        
\par assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans."                       
\par   "How dreadful!" cried Lord Henry. "I can stand brute force, but           
\par brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about           
\par its use. It is hitting below the intellect."                                
\par   "I do not understand you," said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.           
\par   "I do, Lord Henry," murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.                   
\par   "Paradoxes are all very well in their way..." rejoined the Baronet.       
\par   "Was that a paradox?" asked Mr. Erskine. "I did not think so.             
\par Perhaps it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To          
\par test Reality we must see it on the tight-rope. When the Verities            
\par become acrobats we can judge them."                                         
\par   "Dear me!" said Lady Agatha, "how you men argue! I am sure I never        
\par can make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed        
\par with you. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to            
\par give up the East End? I assure you he would be quite invaluable.            
\par They would love his playing."                                               
\par   "I want him to play to me," cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked      
\par down the table and caught a bright answering glance.                        
\par   "But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel," continued Lady Agatha.          
\par   "I can sympathize with everything, except suffering," said Lord           
\par Henry, shrugging his shoulders. "I cannot sympathize with that. It          
\par is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something              
\par terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should                
\par sympathize with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said      
\par about life's sores the better."                                             
\par   "Still, the East End is a very important problem," remarked Sir           
\par Thomas, with a grave shake of the head.                                     
\par   "Quite so," answered the young lord. "It is the problem of                
\par slavery, and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves."                     
\par   The politician looked at him keenly. "What change do you propose,         
\par then?" he asked.                                                            
\par   Lord Henry laughed. "I don't desire to change anything in England         
\par except the weather," he answered. "I am quite content with philosophic      
\par contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt             
\par through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we            
\par should appeal to Science to put us straight. The advantage of the           
\par emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of Science          
\par is that it is not emotional."                                               
\par   "But we have such grave responsibilities," ventured Mrs.                  
\par Vandeleur, timidly.                                                         
\par   "Terribly grave," echoed Lady Agatha.                                     
\par   Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. "Humanity takes itself too         
\par seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the caveman had known         
\par how to laugh; History would have been different."                           
\par   "You are really very comforting," warbled the Duchess. "I have            
\par always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I          
\par take no interest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be          
\par able to look her in the face without a blush."                              
\par   "A blush is very becoming, Duchess," remarked Lord Henry.                 
\par   "Only when one is young," she answered. "When an old woman like           
\par myself blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you           
\par would tell me how to become young again."                                   
\par   He thought for a moment. "Can you remember any great error that           
\par you committed in your early days, Duchess?" he asked, looking at her        
\par across the table.                                                           
\par   "A great many, I fear," she cried.                                        
\par   "Then commit them over again," he said, gravely. "To get back             
\par one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies."                       
\par   "A delightful theory!" she exclaimed. "I must put it into practice."      
\par   "A dangerous theory," came from Sir Thomas's tight lips. Lady Agatha      
\par shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened.      
\par   "Yes," he continued, "that is one of the great secrets of life.           
\par Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and            
\par discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets         
\par are one's mistakes."                                                        
\par   A laugh ran round the room.                                               
\par   He played with the idea, and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and      
\par transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent         
\par with fancy, and winged it with paradox. The praise of folly, as he          
\par went on, soared into a philosophy, and Philosophy herself became            
\par young, and catching the mad music of Pleasure, wearing, one might           
\par fancy, her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a               
\par Bacchante over the hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for           
\par being sober. Facts fled before her like frightened forest things.           
\par Her white feet trod the huge press at which wise Omar sits, till the        
\par seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple           
\par bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat's black, dripping,             
\par sloping sides. It was an extraordinary improvisation. He felt that the      
\par eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him, and the consciousness that           
\par amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he wished to           
\par fascinate, seemed to give his wit keenness, and to lend colour to           
\par his imagination. He was brilliant, fantastic, irresponsible. He             
\par charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they followed his pipe         
\par laughing. Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him, but sat like one         
\par under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips, and wonder          
\par growing grave in his darkening eyes.                                        
\par   At last, liveried in the costume of the age, Reality entered the          
\par room in the shape of a servant to tell the Duchess that her carriage        
\par was waiting. She wrung her hands in mock despair. "How annoying!"           
\par she cried. "I must go. I have to call for my husband at the club, to        
\par take him to some absurd meeting at Willis's Rooms, where he is going        
\par to be in the chair. If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I            
\par couldn't have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh        
\par word would ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. Good-bye, Lord              
\par Henry, you are quite delightful, and dreadfully demoralizing. I am          
\par sure I don't know what to say about your views. You must come and dine      
\par with us some night. Tuesday,? Are you disengaged Tuesday?"                  
\par   "For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess," said Lord Henry, with      
\par a bow.                                                                      
\par   "Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you," she cried; "so            
\par mind you come;" and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha      
\par and the other ladies.                                                       
\par   When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and          
\par taking a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.                  
\par   "You talk books away," he said; "why don't you write one?"                
\par   "I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr.                
\par Erskine. I should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that             
\par would be as lovely as a Persian carpet and as unreal. But there is          
\par no literary public in England for anything except newspapers, primers,      
\par and encyclopaedies. Of all people in the world the English have the         
\par least sense of the beauty of literature."                                   
\par   "I fear you are right," answered Mr. Erskine. "I myself used to have      
\par literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my dear           
\par young friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you         
\par really meant all that you said to us at lunch?"                             
\par   "I quite forget what I said," smiled Lord Henry. "Was it all very         
\par bad?"                                                                       
\par   "Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if      
\par anything happens to our good Duchess we shall all look on you as being      
\par primarily responsible. But I should like to talk to you about life.         
\par The generation into which I was born was tedious. Some day, when you        
\par are tired of London, come down to Treadley, and expound to me your          
\par philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate          
\par enough to possess."                                                         
\par   "I shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege.      
\par It has a perfect host, and a perfect library."                              
\par   "You will complete it," answered the old gentleman, with a courteous      
\par bow. "And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. I am due          
\par at the Athenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there."                      
\par   "All of you, Mr. Erskine?"                                                
\par   "Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an               
\par English Academy of Letters."                                                
\par   Lord Henry laughed, and rose. "I am going to the Park," he cried.         
\par    As he was passing out of the door Dorian Gray touched him on the         
\par arm. "Let me come with you," he murmured.                                   
\par   "But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,"        
\par answered Lord Henry.                                                        
\par   "I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you.          
\par Do let me. And you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one          
\par talks so wonderfully as you do."                                            
\par    "Ah! I have talked quite enough for to-day," said Lord Henry,            
\par smiling. "All I want now is to look at life. You may come and look          
\par at it with me, if you care to."                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                               CHAPTER IV                                    
\par -                                                                           
\par   One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a              
\par luxurious arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry's house in         
\par Mayfair. It was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high            
\par panelled wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze        
\par and ceiling of raised plaster-work, and its brick-dust felt carpet          
\par strewn with silk long-fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny satinwood             
\par table stood a statuette by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of "Les        
\par Cent Nouvelles," bound for Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve, and            
\par powdered with the gilt daisies that Queen had selected for her device.      
\par Some large blue china jars and parrot-tulips were ranged on the             
\par mantelshelf, and through the small leaded panes of the window streamed      
\par the apricot-coloured light of a summer day in London.                       
\par   Lord Henry had not yet come in. He was always late on principle, his      
\par principle being that punctuality is the thief of time. So the lad           
\par was looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over           
\par the pages of an elaborately-illustrated edition of "Manon Lescaut"          
\par that he had found in one of the bookcases. The formal monotonous            
\par ticking of the Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him. Once or twice he           
\par thought of going away.                                                      
\par   At last he heard a step outside, and the door opened. "How late           
\par you are, Harry!" he murmured.                                               
\par   "I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray," answered a shrill voice.         
\par   He glanced quickly round, and rose to his feet. "I beg your               
\par pardon. I thought--"                                                        
\par   "You thought it was my husband. It is only his wife. You must let me      
\par introduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think        
\par my husband has got seventeen of them."                                      
\par   "Not seventeen, Lady Henry?"                                              
\par   "Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the other night at the      
\par Opera." She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her        
\par vague forget-me-not eyes. She was a curious woman, whose dresses            
\par always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a        
\par tempest. She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion         
\par was never returned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to            
\par look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her name was          
\par Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to church.                  
\par   "That was at 'Lohengrin,' Lady Henry, I think?"                           
\par   "Yes; it was at dear 'Lohengrin.' I like Wagner's music better            
\par than anybody's. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without      
\par other people hearing what one says. That is a great advantage: don't        
\par you think so, Mr. Gray?"                                                    
\par   The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her         
\par fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.               
\par   Dorian smiled, and shook his head: "I am afraid I don't think so,         
\par Lady Henry. I never talk during music- at least, during good music. If      
\par one hears bad music, it is one's duty to drown it in conversation."         
\par   "Ah! that is one of Harry's views, isn't it, Mr. Gray? I always hear      
\par Harry's views from his friends. It is the only way I get to know of         
\par them. But you must not think I don't like good music. I adore it,           
\par but I am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply              
\par worshipped pianists- two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me. I don't      
\par know what it is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners.         
\par They all are, ain't they? Even those that are born in England become        
\par foreigners after a time, don't they? It is so clever of them, and such      
\par a compliment to art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn't it? You have      
\par never been to any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray? You must come.         
\par I can't afford orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners. They          
\par make one's rooms look so picturesque. But here is Harry!- Harry, I          
\par came in to look for you, to ask you something- I forget what it was-        
\par and I found Mr. Gray here. We have had such a pleasant chat about           
\par music. We have quite the same ideas. No; I think our ideas are quite        
\par different. But he has been most pleasant. I am so glad I've seen him."      
\par   "I am charmed, my love, quite charmed," said Lord Henry, elevating        
\par his dark crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an          
\par amused smile. "So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to look after a           
\par piece of old brocade in Wardour Street, and had to bargain for hours        
\par for it. Nowadays people know the price of everything, and the value of      
\par nothing."                                                                   
\par   "I am afraid I must be going," exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an          
\par awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. "I have promised to drive      
\par with the Duchess. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You are              
\par dining out, I suppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady             
\par Thornbury's."                                                               
\par   "I dare say, my dear," said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind          
\par her, as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night        
\par in the rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of          
\par frangi-pani. Then he lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on the         
\par sofa.                                                                       
\par   "Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian," he said,          
\par after a few puffs.                                                          
\par   "Why, Harry?"                                                             
\par   "Because they are so sentimental."                                        
\par   "But I like sentimental people."                                          
\par   "Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women      
\par because they are curious: both are disappointed."                           
\par   "I don't think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too much in love.        
\par That is one of your aphorisms. I am putting it into practice, as I          
\par do everything that you say."                                                
\par   "Who are you in love with?" asked Lord Henry, after a pause.              
\par   "With an actress," said Dorian Gray, blushing.                            
\par   Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. "That is a rather commonplace          
\par debut."                                                                     
\par   "You would not say so if you saw her, Harry."                             
\par   "Who is she?"                                                             
\par   "Her name is Sibyl Vane."                                                 
\par   "Never heard of her."                                                     
\par   "No one has. People will some day, however. She is a genius."             
\par   "My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They      
\par never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women               
\par represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the        
\par triumph of mind over morals."                                               
\par   "Harry, how can you?"                                                     
\par   "My dear Dorian, it is quite true. I am analyzing women at                
\par present, so I ought to know. The subject is not so abstruse as I            
\par thought it was. I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of        
\par women, the plain and the coloured. The plain women are very useful. If      
\par you want to gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to        
\par take them down to supper. The other women are very charming. They           
\par commit one mistake, however. They paint in order to try and look            
\par young. Our grandmothers painted in order to try and talk                    
\par brilliantly. Rouge and esprit used to go together. That is all over         
\par now. As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own             
\par daughter, she is perfectly satisfied. As for conversation, there are        
\par only five women in London worth talking to and two of these can't be        
\par admitted into decent society. However, tell me about your genius.           
\par How long have you known her?"                                               
\par   "Ah! Harry, your views terrify me."                                       
\par   "Never mind that. How long have you known her?"                           
\par   "About three weeks."                                                      
\par   "And where did you come across her?"                                      
\par   "I will tell you, Harry; but you mustn't be unsympathetic about           
\par it. After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you.           
\par You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. For         
\par days after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. As I           
\par lounged in the Park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at         
\par every one who passed me, and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort        
\par of lives they led. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me with        
\par terror. There was an exquisite poison in the air. I had a passion           
\par for sensations.... Well, one evening about seven o'clock, I determined      
\par to go out in search of some adventure. I felt that this grey,               
\par monstrous London of ours, with its myriads of people, its sordid            
\par sinners, and its splendid sins, as you once phrased it, must have           
\par something in store for me. I fancied a thousand things. The mere            
\par danger gave me a sense of delight. I remembered what you had said to        
\par me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together, about the        
\par search for beauty being the real secret of life. I don't know what I        
\par expected, but I went out and wandered eastward, soon losing my way          
\par in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black, grassless squares. About         
\par half-past eight I passed by an absurd little theatre, with great            
\par flaring gas-jets and gaudy playbills. A hideous Jew, in the most            
\par amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was standing at the             
\par entrance, smoking a vile cigar. He had greasy ringlets, and an              
\par enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt. 'Have a            
\par box, My Lord?' he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with        
\par an air of gorgeous servility. There was something about him, Harry,         
\par that amused me. He was such a monster. You will laugh at me, I know,        
\par but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box. To the      
\par present day I can't make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn't- my          
\par dear Harry, if I hadn't, I should have missed the greatest romance          
\par of my life. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!"                   
\par   "I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you. But        
\par you should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say        
\par the first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will      
\par always be in love with love. A grande passion is the privilege of           
\par people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes      
\par of a country. Don't be afraid. There are exquisite things in store for      
\par you. This is merely the beginning."                                         
\par   "Do you think my nature so shallow?" cried Dorian Gray, angrily.          
\par   "No; I think your nature so deep."                                        
\par   "How do you mean?"                                                        
\par   "My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are            
\par really the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their          
\par fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of             
\par imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is      
\par to the life of the intellect- simply a confession of failure.               
\par Faithfulness! I must analyze it some day. The passion for property          
\par is in it. There are many things that we would throw away if we were         
\par not afraid that others might pick them up. But I don't want to              
\par interrupt you. Go on with your story."                                      
\par   "Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with         
\par a vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. I looked out from behind        
\par the curtain, and surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair, all            
\par Cupids and cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The gallery         
\par and pit were fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were             
\par quite empty, and there was hardly a person in what I suppose they           
\par called the dress-circle. Women went about with oranges and                  
\par ginger-beer, and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on."        
\par   "It must have been just like the palmy days of the British Drama."        
\par   "Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder        
\par what on earth I should do, when I caught sight of the play-bill.            
\par What do you think the play was, Harry?"                                     
\par   "I should think 'The Idiot Boy, or Dumb but Innocent.' Our fathers        
\par used to like that sort of piece, I believe. The longer I live, Dorian,      
\par the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers        
\par is not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, les grandperes           
\par ont toujours tort."                                                         
\par   "This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was 'Romeo and Juliet.'      
\par I must admit I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare         
\par done in such a wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested,          
\par in a sort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act.      
\par There was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who         
\par sat at a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the          
\par drop-scene was drawn up, and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly      
\par gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure        
\par like a beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by the        
\par low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most            
\par friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the             
\par scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But      
\par Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a        
\par little flower-like face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of           
\par dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that          
\par were like the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever      
\par seen in my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but      
\par that beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you,      
\par Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came         
\par across me. And her voice- I never heard such a voice. It was very           
\par low at first, with deep mellow notes, that seemed to fall singly            
\par upon one's ear. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a          
\par flute or a distant haut-bois. In the garden-scene it had all the            
\par tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales         
\par are singing. There was moments, later on, when it had the wild passion      
\par of violins. You know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the           
\par voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget. When I        
\par close my eyes, I hear them, and each of them says something different.      
\par I don't know which to follow. Why should I not love her? Harry, I do        
\par love her. She is everything to me in life. Night after night I go to        
\par see her play. One evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening- she        
\par is Imogen. I have seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb,             
\par sucking the poison from her lover's lips. I have watched her wandering      
\par through the forest of Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and          
\par doublet and dainty cap. She has been mad, and has come into the             
\par presence of a guilty king, and given him rue to wear, and bitter herbs      
\par to taste of. She has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy         
\par have crushed her reed-like throat. I have seen her in every age and in      
\par every costume. Ordinary women never appeal to one's imagination.            
\par They are limited to their century. No glamour ever transfigures             
\par them. One knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets.           
\par One can always find them. There is no mystery in any of them: they          
\par ride in the Park in the morning, and chatter at tea-parties in the          
\par afternoon. They have their stereotyped smile, and their fashionable         
\par manner. They are quite obvious. But an actress! How different an            
\par actress is! Harry! why didn't you tell me that the only thing worth         
\par loving is an actress?"                                                      
\par   "Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian."                           
\par   "Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces."                
\par   "Don't run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an                  
\par extraordinary charm in them, sometimes," said Lord Henry.                   
\par   "I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane."                         
\par   "You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life      
\par you will tell me everything you do."                                        
\par   "Yes, Harry, I believe that is true, I cannot help telling you            
\par things. You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I      
\par would come and confess it to you. You would understand me."                 
\par   "People like you- the wilful sunbeams of life- don't commit               
\par crimes, Dorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the           
\par same. And now tell me- reach me the matches, like a good boy: thanks:-      
\par what are your actual relations with Sibyl Vane?"                            
\par   Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning           
\par eyes. "Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!"                                        
\par   "It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian," said      
\par Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. "But why           
\par should you be annoyed? I suppose she will belong to you some day. When      
\par one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one's self, and one          
\par always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a             
\par romance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?"                             
\par   "Of course I know her. On the first night I was at the theatre,           
\par the horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was          
\par over, and offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to          
\par her. I was furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead         
\par for hundreds of years, and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in      
\par Verona. I think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under        
\par the impression that I had taken too much champagne, or something."          
\par   "I am not surprised."                                                     
\par   "Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers. I told him I      
\par never even read them. He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and          
\par confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy           
\par against him, and that they were every one of them to be bought."            
\par   "I should not wonder if he was quite right there. But, on the             
\par other hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at        
\par all expensive."                                                             
\par   "Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means," laughed            
\par Dorian. "By this time, however, the lights were being put out in the        
\par theatre, and I had to go. He wanted me to try some cigars that he           
\par strongly recommended. I declined. The next night, of course, I arrived      
\par at the place again. When he saw me he made a low bow, and assured me        
\par that I was a munificent patron of art. He was a most offensive              
\par brute, though he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare. He told      
\par me once, with an air of pride, that his five bankruptcies were              
\par entirely due to 'The Bard,' as he insisted on calling him. He seemed        
\par to think it a distinction."                                                 
\par   "It was a distinction, my dear Dorian- a great distinction. Most          
\par people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the           
\par prose of life. To have ruined one's self over poetry is an honour. But      
\par when did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?"                               
\par   "The third night. She had been playing Rosalind. I could not help         
\par going round. I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at           
\par me; at least I fancied that she had. The old Jew was persistent. He         
\par seemed determined to take me behind, so I consented. It was curious my      
\par not wanting to know her, wasn't it?"                                        
\par   "No; I don't think so."                                                   
\par   "My dear Harry, why?"                                                     
\par   "I will tell you some other time. Now I want to know about the            
\par girl."                                                                      
\par   "Sibyl? Oh, she was so shy, and so gentle. There is something of a        
\par child about her. Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I            
\par told her what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite            
\par unconscious of her power. I think we were both rather nervous. The old      
\par Jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making            
\par elaborate speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other      
\par like children. He would insist on calling me 'My Lord,' so I had to         
\par assure Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind. She said quite            
\par simply to me, 'You look more like a prince. I must call you Prince          
\par Charming.'"                                                                 
\par   "Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments."          
\par   "You don't understand her, Harry. She regarded me merely as a person      
\par in a play. She knows nothing of life. She lives with her mother, a          
\par faded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta              
\par dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen           
\par better days."                                                               
\par   "I know that look. It depresses me," murmured Lord Henry,                 
\par examining his rings.                                                        
\par   "The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not             
\par interest me."                                                               
\par   "You were quite right. There is always something infinitely mean          
\par about other people's tragedies."                                            
\par   "Sibyl is the only thing I care about. What is it to me where she         
\par came from? From her little head to her little feet, she is                  
\par absolutely and entirely divine. Every night of my life I go to see her      
\par act, and every night she is more marvellous."                               
\par   "That is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now. I        
\par thought you must have some curious romance on hand. You have; but it        
\par is not quite what I expected."                                              
\par   "My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I          
\par have been to the Opera with you several times," said Dorian, opening        
\par his blue eyes in wonder.                                                    
\par   "You always come dreadfully late."                                        
\par   "Well, I can't help going to see Sibyl play," he cried, "even if          
\par it is only for a single act. I get hungry for her presence; and when I      
\par think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory        
\par body, I am filled with awe."                                                
\par   "You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can't you?"                       
\par   He shook his head. "To-night she is Imogen," he answered, "and            
\par to-morrow night she will be Juliet."                                        
\par   "When is she Sibyl Vane?"                                                 
\par   "Never."                                                                  
\par   "I congratulate you."                                                     
\par   "How horrid you are! She is all the great heroines of the world in        
\par one. She is more than an individual. You laugh, but I tell you she has      
\par genius. I love her, and I must make her love me. You, who know all the      
\par secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me! I want to      
\par make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our         
\par laughter, and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir their        
\par dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. My God, Harry,      
\par how I worship her!" He was walking up and down the room as he spoke.        
\par Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks. He was terribly excited.          
\par   Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. How               
\par different he was now from the shy, frightened boy he had met in             
\par Basil Hallward's studio! His nature had developed like a flower, had        
\par borne blossoms of scarlet flame. Out of its secret hiding-place had         
\par crept his Soul, and Desire had come to meet it on the way.                  
\par   "And what do you propose to do?" said Lord Henry, at last.                
\par   "I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act.         
\par I have not the slightest fear of the result. You are certain to             
\par acknowledge her genius. Then we must get her out of the Jew's hands.        
\par She is bound to him for three years- at least for two years and             
\par eight months- from the present time. I shall have to pay him                
\par something, of course. When all that is settled, I shall take a West         
\par End theatre and bring her out properly. She will make the world as mad      
\par as she has made me."                                                        
\par   "That would be impossible, my dear boy."                                  
\par   "Yes, she will. She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct,          
\par in her but she has personality also; and you have often told me that        
\par it is personalities, not principles, that move the age."                    
\par   "Well, what night shall we go?"                                           
\par   "Let me see. To-day is Tuesday. Let us fix to-morrow. She plays           
\par Juliet to-morrow."                                                          
\par   "All right. The Bristol at eight o'clock; and I will get Basil."          
\par   "Not eight, Harry, please. Half-past six. We must be there before         
\par the curtain rises. You must see her in the first act, where she             
\par meets Romeo."                                                               
\par   "Half-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea,          
\par or reading an English novel. It must be seven. No gentleman dines           
\par before seven. Shall you see Basil between this and then? Or shall I         
\par write to him?"                                                              
\par   "Dear Basil! I have not laid eyes on him for a week. It is rather         
\par horrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful           
\par frame, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little             
\par jealous of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I         
\par must admit that I delight in it. Perhaps you had better write to            
\par him. I don't want to see him alone. He says things that annoy me. He        
\par gives me good advice."                                                      
\par   Lord Henry smiled. "People are very fond of giving away what they         
\par need most themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity."           
\par   "Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a        
\par bit of a Philistine. Since I have known you, Harry, I have                  
\par discovered that."                                                           
\par   "Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into         
\par his work. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his      
\par prejudices, his principles, and his common sense. The only artists I        
\par have ever known, who are personally delightful, are bad artists.            
\par Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are           
\par perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great      
\par poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets           
\par are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more            
\par picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of          
\par second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the            
\par poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they          
\par dare not realize."                                                          
\par   "I wonder is that really so, Harry?" said Dorian Gray, putting            
\par some perfume on his handkerchief out of a large gold-topped bottle          
\par that stood on the table. "It must be, if you say it. And now I'm            
\par off. Imogen is waiting for me. Don't forget about to-morrow.                
\par Good-bye."                                                                  
\par   As he left the room Lord Henry's heavy eyelids drooped, and he began      
\par to think. Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as           
\par Dorian Gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration of some one else caused        
\par him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by      
\par it. It made him a more interesting study. He had always been                
\par enthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject      
\par matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And      
\par so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting      
\par others. Human life- that appeared to him the one thing worth                
\par investigating. Compared to it there was nothing else of any value.          
\par It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain        
\par and pleasure, one could not wear over one's face a mask of glass,           
\par nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making           
\par the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams.         
\par There were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had          
\par to sicken of them. There were maladies so strange that one had to pass      
\par through them if one sought to understand their nature. And, yet,            
\par what a great reward one received! How wonderful the whole world became      
\par to one! To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional        
\par coloured life of the intellect- to observe where they met, and where        
\par they separated, at what point they were in unison, and at what point        
\par they were at discord- there was a delight in that. What matter what         
\par the cost was? One could never pay too high a price for any sensation.       
\par   He was conscious- and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into        
\par his brown agate eyes- that it was through certain words of his,             
\par musical words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray's soul had      
\par turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. To a             
\par large extent the lad was his own creation. He had made him                  
\par premature. That was something. Ordinary people waited till life             
\par disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the            
\par mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away.             
\par Sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of             
\par literature, which dealt immediately with the passions and the               
\par intellect. But now and then a complex personality took the place and        
\par assumed the office of art, was indeed, in its way, a real work of art,      
\par Life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has, or              
\par sculpture, or painting.                                                     
\par   Yes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it         
\par was yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was      
\par becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him. With his           
\par beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at.        
\par It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He was like      
\par one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys            
\par seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one's sense of           
\par beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.                                
\par   Soul and body, body and soul- how mysterious they were! There was         
\par animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.        
\par The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could         
\par say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse              
\par began? How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary               
\par psychologists! And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of        
\par the various schools! Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin?      
\par Or was the body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The          
\par separation of spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of            
\par spirit with matter was a mystery also.                                      
\par    He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so              
\par absolute a science that each little spring of life would be revealed        
\par to us. As it was, we always misunderstood ourselves, and rarely             
\par understood others. Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely        
\par the name men gave to their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule,              
\par regarded it as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical      
\par efficacy in the formation of character, had praised it as something         
\par that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid. But there        
\par was no motive power in experience. It was as little of an active cause      
\par as conscience itself. All that it really demonstrated was that our          
\par future would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done          
\par once, and with loathing, we would do many times, and with joy.              
\par   It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method      
\par by which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the                 
\par passions; and certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand,         
\par and seemed to promise rich and fruitful results. His sudden mad love        
\par for Sibyl Vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest.         
\par There was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity         
\par and the desire for new experiences; yet it was not a simple but rather      
\par a very complex passion. What there was in it of the purely sensuous         
\par instinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the             
\par imagination, changed into something that seemed to the lad himself          
\par to be remote from sense, and was for that very reason all the more          
\par dangerous. It was the passions about whose origin we deceived               
\par ourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us. Our weakest motives        
\par were those of whose nature we were conscious. It often happened that        
\par when we thought we were experimenting on others we were really              
\par experimenting on ourselves.                                                 
\par   While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the        
\par door, and his valet entered, and reminded him it was time to dress for      
\par dinner. He got up and looked out into the street. The sunset had            
\par smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite.         
\par The panes glowed like plates of heated metal. The sky above was like a      
\par faded rose. He thought of his friend's young fiery-coloured life,           
\par and wondered how it was all going to end.                                   
\par   When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o'clock, he saw a            
\par telegram lying on the hall table. He opened it, and found it was            
\par from Dorian Gray. It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married      
\par to Sibyl Vane.                                                              
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                               CHAPTER V                                     
\par -                                                                           
\par   "Mother, mother, I am so happy!" whispered the girl, burying her          
\par face in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back            
\par turned to the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair      
\par that their dingy sitting-room contained. "I am so happy!" she               
\par repeated, "and you must be happy too!"                                      
\par   Mrs. Vane winced, and put her thin bismuth-whitened hands on her          
\par daughter's head. "Happy!" she echoed, "I am only happy, Sibyl, when         
\par I see you act. You must not think of anything but your acting. Mr.          
\par Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money."                     
\par   The girl looked up and pouted. "Money, mother?" she cried. "What          
\par does money matter? Love is more than money."                                
\par   "Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts, and        
\par to get a proper outfit for James. You must not forget that, Sibyl.          
\par Fifty pounds is a very large sum. Mr. Isaacs has been most                  
\par considerate."                                                               
\par   "He is not a gentleman, mother, and I hate the way he talks to            
\par me," said the girl, rising to her feet, and going over to the window.       
\par   "I don't know how we could manage without him," answered the elder        
\par woman, querulously.                                                         
\par   Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed. "We don't want him any more,      
\par mother. Prince Charming rules life for us now." Then she paused. A          
\par rose shook in her blood, and shadowed her cheeks. Quick breaths parted      
\par the petals of her lips. They trembled. Some southern wind of passion        
\par swept over her, and stirred the dainty folds of her dress. "I love          
\par him," she said, simply,.                                                    
\par   "Foolish child! foolish child!" was the parrot-phrase flung in            
\par answer. The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave                  
\par grotesqueness to the words.                                                 
\par   The girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her voice.         
\par Her eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance: then closed           
\par for a moment, as though to hide their secret. When they opened, the         
\par mist of a dream had passed across them.                                     
\par   Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at            
\par prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the          
\par name of common sense. She did not listen. She was free in her prison        
\par of passion. Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her. She had              
\par called on Memory to remake him. She had sent her soul to search for         
\par him, and it had brought him back. His kiss burned again upon her            
\par mouth. Her eyelids were warm with his breath.                               
\par   Then Wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery.         
\par This young man might be rich. If so, marriage should be thought of.         
\par Against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. The        
\par arrows of craft shot by her. She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.      
\par   Suddenly she felt the need to speak. The wordy silence troubled her.      
\par "Mother, mother," she cried, "why does he love me so much? I know           
\par why I love him. I love him because he is like what Love himself should      
\par be. But what does he see in me? I am not worthy of him. And yet-            
\par why, I cannot tell- though I feel so much beneath him, I don't feel         
\par humble. I feel proud, terribly proud. Mother, did you love my father        
\par as I love Prince Charming?"                                                 
\par   The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed           
\par her cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. Sibyl           
\par rushed to her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her. "Forgive      
\par me, mother. I know it pains you to talk about our father. But it            
\par only pains you because you loved him so much. Don't look so sad. I          
\par am as happy to-day as you were twenty years ago. Ah! let me be happy        
\par forever!"                                                                   
\par   "My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love.             
\par Besides, what do you know of this young man. You don't even know his        
\par name. The whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James          
\par is going away to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say      
\par that you should have shown more consideration. However, as I said           
\par before, if he is rich..."                                                   
\par   "Ah! mother, mother, let me be happy!"                                    
\par   Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical          
\par gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a                  
\par stage-player, clasped her in her arms. At this moment the door opened,      
\par and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room. He was            
\par thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large, and somewhat        
\par clumsy in movement. He was not so finely bred as his sister. One would      
\par hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between             
\par them. Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him, and intensified her smile.           
\par She mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience. She            
\par felt sure that the tableau was interesting.                                 
\par   "You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think," said         
\par the lad, with a good-natured grumble.                                       
\par   "Ah! but you don't like being kissed, Jim," she cried. "You are a         
\par dreadful old bear." And she ran across the room and hugged him.             
\par   James Vane looked into his sister's face with tenderness. "I want         
\par you to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl. I don't suppose I shall          
\par ever see this horrid London again. I am sure I don't want to."              
\par   "My son, don't say such dreadful things," murmured Mrs. Vane, taking      
\par up a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch           
\par it. She felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group.        
\par It would have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the               
\par situation.                                                                  
\par   "Why not, mother? I mean it."                                             
\par   "You pain me, my son. I trust you will return from Australia in a         
\par position of affluence. I believe there is no society of any kind in         
\par the Colonies, nothing that I would call society; so when you have made      
\par your fortune you must come back and assert yourself in London."             
\par   "Society!" muttered the lad. "I don't want to know anything about         
\par that. I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the        
\par stage. I hate it."                                                          
\par   "Oh, Jim!" said Sibyl, laughing, "how unkind of you! But are you          
\par really going for a walk with me? That will be nice! I was afraid you        
\par were going to say good-bye to some of your friends- to Tom Hardy,           
\par who gave you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you        
\par for smoking it. It is very sweet of you to let me have your last            
\par afternoon. Where shall we go? Let us go to the Park."                       
\par   "I am too shabby," he answered, frowning. "Only swell people go to        
\par the Park."                                                                  
\par   "Nonsense, Jim," she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.          
\par   He hesitated for a moment. "Very well," he said at last, "but             
\par don't be to long dressing." She danced out of the door. One could hear      
\par her singing as she ran upstairs. Her little feet pattered overhead.         
\par   He walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he turned to      
\par the still figure in the chair. "Mother, are my things ready?" he            
\par asked.                                                                      
\par   "Quite ready, James," she answered, keeping her eyes on her work.         
\par For some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone            
\par with this rough, stern son of hers. Her shallow secret nature was           
\par troubled when their eyes met. She used to wonder if he suspected            
\par anything. The silence, for he made no other observation, became             
\par intolerable to her. She began to complain. Women defend themselves          
\par by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. "I      
\par hope you will be contented, James, with your sea-faring life," she          
\par said. "You must remember that it is your own choice. You might have         
\par entered a solicitor's office. Solicitors are a very respectable class,      
\par and in the country often dine with the best families."                      
\par   "I hate offices, and I hate clerks," he replied. "But you are             
\par quite right. I have chosen my own life. All I say is, watch over            
\par Sibyl. Don't let her come to any harm. Mother, you must watch over          
\par her."                                                                       
\par   "James, you really talk very strangely. Of course I watch over            
\par Sibyl."                                                                     
\par   "I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre, and goes            
\par behind to talk to her. Is that right? What about that?"                     
\par   "You are speaking about things you don't understand, James. In the        
\par profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most                
\par gratifying attention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one         
\par time. That was when acting was really understood. As for Sibyl, I do        
\par not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not. But           
\par there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect               
\par gentleman. He is always most polite to me. Besides, he has the              
\par appearance of being rich, and the flowers he sends are lovely."             
\par   "You don't know his name, though," said the lad, harshly.                 
\par   "No," answered his mother, with a placid expression in her face. "He      
\par has not yet revealed his real name. I think it is quite romantic of         
\par him. He is probably a member of the aristocracy."                           
\par   James Vane bit his lip. "Watch over Sibyl, mother," he cried, "watch      
\par over her."                                                                  
\par   "My son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my special      
\par care. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason           
\par why she could not contract an alliance with him. I trust he is one          
\par of the aristocracy. He has all the appearance of it, I must say. It         
\par might be a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl. They would make a             
\par charming couple. His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody      
\par notices them."                                                              
\par   The lad muttered something to himself, and drummed on the windowpane      
\par with his coarse fingers. He had just turned round to say something,         
\par when the door opened, and Sibyl ran in.                                     
\par   "How serious you both are!" she cried. "What is the matter?"              
\par   "Nothing," he answered. "I suppose one must be serious sometimes.         
\par Good-bye, mother. I will have my dinner at five o'clock. Everything is      
\par packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble."                         
\par   "Good-bye, my son," she answered, with a bow of strained                  
\par stateliness.                                                                
\par   She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and        
\par there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.              
\par   "Kiss me, mother," said the girl. Her flower-like lips touched the        
\par withered cheek, and warmed its frost.                                       
\par   "My child! my child!" cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling          
\par in search of an imaginary gallery.                                          
\par   "Come, Sibyl," said her brother, impatiently. He hated his                
\par mother's affectations.                                                      
\par   They went out into the flickering wind-blown sunlight, and                
\par strolled down the dreary Euston Road. The passers-by glanced in wonder      
\par at the sullen, heavy youth, who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was        
\par in the company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl. He was like a      
\par common gardener walking with a rose.                                        
\par   Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive              
\par glance of some stranger. He had that dislike of being stared at             
\par which comes on geniuses late in life, and never leaves the                  
\par commonplace. Sibyl, however, was quite unconscious of the effect she        
\par was producing. Her love was trembling in laughter on her lips. She was      
\par thinking of Prince Charming, and, that she might think of him all           
\par the more, she did not talk of him, but prattled on about the ship in        
\par which Jim was going to sail, about the gold he was certain to find,         
\par about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked,      
\par red-shirted bushrangers. For he was not to remain a sailor, or a            
\par super-cargo, or whatever he was going to be. Oh, no! A sailor's             
\par existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship, with        
\par the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black wind            
\par blowing the masts down, and tearing the sails into long screaming           
\par ribands! He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite              
\par good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields. Before      
\par a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure gold, the      
\par largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it down to the      
\par coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen. The bushrangers         
\par were to attack them three times, and be defeated with immense               
\par slaughter. Or, no. He was not to go to the gold-fields at all. They         
\par were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other          
\par in bar-rooms, and used bad language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer,      
\par and one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful         
\par heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give            
\par chase, and rescue her. Of course she would fall in love with him,           
\par and he with her, and they would get married, and come home, and live        
\par in an immense house in London. Yes, there were delightful things in         
\par store for him. But he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or        
\par spend his money foolishly. She was only a year older than he was,           
\par but she knew so much more of life. He must be sure, also, to write          
\par to her by every mail, and to say his prayers each night before he went      
\par to sleep. God was very good, and would watch over him. She would            
\par pray for him too, and in a few years he would come back quite rich and      
\par happy.                                                                      
\par   The lad listened sulkily to her, and made no answer. He was               
\par heart-sick at leaving home.                                                 
\par   Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.                
\par Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger      
\par of Sibyl's position. This young dandy who was making love to her could      
\par mean her no good. He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated      
\par him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account,      
\par and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him. He was      
\par conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother's nature,        
\par and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness.             
\par Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they             
\par judge them; sometimes they forgive them.                                    
\par   His mother! He had something on his mind to ask her, something            
\par that he had brooded on for many months of silence. A chance phrase          
\par that he had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached        
\par his ears one night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a          
\par train of horrible thoughts. He remembered it as if it had been the          
\par lash of a hunting-crop across his face. His brows knit together into a      
\par wedge-like furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his under-lip.          
\par   "You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim," cried Sibyl,          
\par "and I am making the most delightful plans for your future. Do say          
\par something."                                                                 
\par   "What do you want me to say?"                                             
\par   "Oh! that you will be a good boy, and not forget us," she                 
\par answered, smiling at him.                                                   
\par   He shrugged his shoulders. "You are more likely to forget me, than I      
\par am to forget you, Sibyl."                                                   
\par   She flushed. "What do you mean, Jim?" she asked.                          
\par   "You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told          
\par me about him? He means you no good."                                        
\par   "Stop, Jim!" she exclaimed. "You must not say anything against            
\par him. I love him."                                                           
\par   "Why, you don't even know his name," answered the lad. "Who is he? I      
\par have a right to know."                                                      
\par   "He is called Prince Charming. Don't you like the name? Oh! you           
\par silly boy,! you should never forget it. If you only saw him, you would      
\par think him the most wonderful person in the world. Some day you will         
\par meet him: when you come back from Australia. You will like him so           
\par much. Everybody likes him, and I... love him. I wish you could come to      
\par the theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play             
\par Juliet. Oh! how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play         
\par Juliet! To have him sitting there! To play for his delight! I am            
\par afraid I may frighten the company, frighten or enthrall them. To be in      
\par love is to surpass one's self. Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be             
\par shouting 'genius' to his loafers at the bar. He has preached me as a        
\par dogma; to-night he will announce me as a revelation. I feel it. And it      
\par is all his, his only, Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of        
\par graces. But I am poor beside him. Poor? What does that matter? When         
\par poverty creeps in at the door, love flies in through the window. Our        
\par proverbs want re-writing. They were made in winter, and it is summer        
\par now; spring-time for me, I think, a very dance of blossoms in blue          
\par skies."                                                                     
\par   "He is a gentleman," said the lad, sullenly.                              
\par   "A Prince!" she cried, musically. "What more do you want?"                
\par   "He wants to enslave you."                                                
\par   "I shudder at the thought of being free."                                 
\par   "I want you to beware of him."                                            
\par   "To see him is to worship him, to know him is to trust him."              
\par   "Sibyl, you are mad about him."                                           
\par   She laughed, and took his arm. "You dear old Jim, you talk as if you      
\par were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you will        
\par know what it is. Don't look so sulky. Surely you should be glad to          
\par think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I          
\par have ever been before. Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard        
\par and difficult. But it will be different now. You are going to a new         
\par world, and I have found one. Here are two chairs; let us sit down           
\par and see the smart people go by."                                            
\par   They took their seats amidst a crowd if watchers. The tulip-beds          
\par across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white dust,          
\par tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed, hung in the panting air.           
\par The brightly-coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous             
\par butterflies.                                                                
\par   She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects. He        
\par spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as            
\par players at a game pass counters. Sibyl felt pressed. She could not          
\par communicate her joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all        
\par the echo she could win. After some time she became silent. Suddenly         
\par she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an            
\par open carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.                       
\par   She started to her feet. "There he is!" she cried.                        
\par   "Who?" said Jim Vane.                                                     
\par   "Prince Charming," she answered, looking after the victoria.              
\par   He jumped up, and seized her roughly by the arm. "Show him to me.         
\par Which is he? Point him out. I must see him!" he exclaimed; but at that      
\par moment the Duke of Berwick's four-in-hand came between, and when it         
\par had left the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the Park.           
\par   "He is gone," murmured Sibyl, sadly. "I wish you had seen him."           
\par   "I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever        
\par does you any wrong, I shall kill him."                                      
\par   She looked at him in horror. He repeated his words. They cut the air      
\par like a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing close        
\par to her tittered.                                                            
\par   "Come away, Jim; come away," she whispered. He followed her doggedly      
\par as she passed through the crowd. He felt glad at what he had said.          
\par   When they reached the Achilles Statue she turned round. There was         
\par pity in her eyes that became laughter on her lips. She shook her            
\par head at him. "You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered         
\par boy, that is all. How can you say such horrible things? You don't know      
\par what you are talking about. You are simply jealous and unkind. Ah! I        
\par wish you would fall in love. Love makes people good, and what you said      
\par was wicked."                                                                
\par   "I am sixteen," he answered, "and I know what I am about. Mother          
\par is no help to you. She doesn't understand how to look after you. I          
\par wish now that I was not going to Australia at all. I have a great mind      
\par to chuck the whole thing up. I would, if my articles hadn't been            
\par signed."                                                                    
\par   "Oh, don't be so serious, Jim. You are like one of the heroes of          
\par those silly melodramas mother used to be so fond of acting in. I am         
\par not going to quarrel with you. I have seen him, and oh! to see him          
\par is perfect happiness. We won't quarrel. I know you would never harm         
\par any one I love, would you?"                                                 
\par   "Not as long as you love him, I suppose," was the sullen answer.          
\par   "I shall love him for ever!" she cried.                                   
\par   "And he?"                                                                 
\par   "For ever, too!"                                                          
\par   "He had better."                                                          
\par   She shrank from him. Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm.        
\par He was merely a boy.                                                        
\par   At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close          
\par to their shabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five o'clock,         
\par and Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim          
\par insisted that she should do so. He said that he would sooner part with      
\par her when their mother was not present. She would be sure to make a          
\par scene, and he detested scenes of every kind.                                
\par   In Sibyl's own room they parted. There was jealousy in the lad's          
\par heart, and a fierce, murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it            
\par seemed to him, had come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung         
\par around his neck, and her fingers strayed through his hair, he               
\par softened, and kissed her with real affection. There were tears in           
\par his eyes as he went downstairs.                                             
\par   His mother was waiting for him below. She grumbled at his                 
\par unpunctuality, as he entered. He made no answer, but sat down to his        
\par meagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table, and crawled over the         
\par stained cloth. Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of          
\par street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute          
\par that was left to him.                                                       
\par   After some time, he thrust away his plate, and put his head in his        
\par hands. He felt that he had a right to know. It should have been told        
\par to him before, if it was as he suspected. Leaden with fear, his mother      
\par watched him. Words dropped mechanically from her lips. A tattered lace      
\par handkerchief twitched in her fingers. When the clock struck six, he         
\par got up, and went to the door. When he turned back, and looked at            
\par her. Their eyes met. In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy. It             
\par enraged him.                                                                
\par   "Mother, I have something to ask you," he said. Her eyes wandered         
\par vaguely about the room. She made no answer. "Tell me the truth. I have      
\par a right to know. Were you married to my father?"                            
\par   She heaved a deep sigh. It was a sigh of relief. The terrible             
\par moment, the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had        
\par dreaded, had come at last, and yet she felt no terror. Indeed in            
\par some measure it was a disappointment to her. The vulgar directness          
\par of the question called for a direct answer. The situation had not been      
\par gradually led up to. It was crude. It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.      
\par   "No," she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.            
\par   "My father was a scoundrel then!" cried the lad, clenching his            
\par fists.                                                                      
\par   She shook her head. "I knew he was not free. We loved each other          
\par very much. If he had lived, he would have made provision for us. Don't      
\par speak against him, my son. He was your father, and a gentleman. Indeed      
\par he was highly connected."                                                   
\par   An oath broke from his lips. "I don't care for myself," he                
\par exclaimed, "but don't let Sibyl... It is a gentleman, isn't it, who is      
\par in love with her, or says he is? Highly connected, too, I suppose."         
\par   For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. Her      
\par head drooped. She wiped her eyes with shaking hands. "Sibyl has a           
\par mother," she murmured; "I had none."                                        
\par   The lad was touched. He went towards her, and stooping down he            
\par kissed her. "I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my             
\par father," he said, "but I could not help it. I must go now. Good-bye.        
\par Don't forget that you will have only one child now to look after,           
\par and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out           
\par who he is, track him down, and kill him like a dog. I swear it."            
\par   The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that          
\par accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more             
\par vivid to her. She was familiar with the atmosphere. She breathed            
\par more freely, and for the first time in many months she really               
\par admired her son. She would have liked to have continued the scene on        
\par the same emotional scale, but he cut her short. Trunks had to be            
\par carried down, and mufflers looked for. The lodging-house drudge             
\par bustled in and out. There was the bargaining with the cab-man. The          
\par moment was lost in vulgar details. It was with a renewed feeling of         
\par disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from           
\par the window, as her son drove away. She was conscious that a great           
\par opportunity had been wasted. She consoled herself by telling Sibyl how      
\par desolate she felt her life would be, now that she had only one child        
\par to look after. She remembered the phrase. It had pleased her. Of the        
\par threat she said nothing. It was vividly and dramatically expressed.         
\par She felt that they would all laugh at it some day.                          
\par

\par   "I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?" said Lord Henry that          
\par evening, as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the            
\par Bristol where dinner had been laid for three.                               
\par   "No, Harry," answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the          
\par bowing waiter. "What is it? Nothing about politics, I hope? They don't      
\par interest me. There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons        
\par worth painting; though many of them would be the better for a little        
\par whitewashing."                                                              
\par   "Dorian Gray is engaged to be married," said Lord Henry, watching         
\par him as he spoke.                                                            
\par   Hallward started, and then frowned. "Dorian engaged to be                 
\par married!" he cried. "Impossible!"                                           
\par   "It is perfectly true."

\par   "To some little actress or other."                                        
\par   "I can't believe it. Dorian is far too sensible."                         
\par   "Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my         
\par dear Basil."                                                                
\par   "Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry."         
\par   "Except in America," rejoined Lord Henry, languidly. "But I didn't        
\par say he was married. I said he was engaged to be married. There is a         
\par great difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married,           
\par but I have no recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to        
\par think that I never was engaged."                                            
\par   "But think of Dorian's birth, and position, and wealth. It would          
\par be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him."                            
\par   "If you want to make him marry this girl tell him that, Basil. He is      
\par sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it      
\par is always from the noblest motives."                                        
\par   "I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don't want to see Dorian tied          
\par to some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his            
\par intellect."                                                                 
\par   "Oh, she is better than good- she is beautiful," murmured Lord            
\par Henry, sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. "Dorian says         
\par she is beautiful; and he is not often wrong about things of that kind.      
\par Your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal         
\par appearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect,               
\par amongst others. We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn't forget      
\par his appointment."                                                           
\par   "Are you serious?"                                                        
\par   "Quite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I should        
\par ever be more serious than I am at the present moment."                      
\par   "But do you approve of it, Harry?" asked the painter, walking up and      
\par down the room, and biting his lip. "You can't approve of it, possibly.      
\par It is some silly infatuation."                                              
\par   "I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd         
\par attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air        
\par our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people         
\par say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a               
\par personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that                 
\par personality selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray             
\par falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to        
\par marry her. Why not? If he wedded Messalina he would be none the less        
\par interesting. You know I am not a champion of marriage. The real             
\par drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish. And unselfish          
\par people are colourless. They lack individuality. Still, there are            
\par certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex. They retain          
\par their egotism, and add to it many other egos. They are forced to            
\par have more than one life. They become highly organized, and to be            
\par highly organized is, I should fancy, the object of man's existence.         
\par Besides, every experience is of value, and, whatever one may say            
\par against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I hope that Dorian         
\par Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore her for six           
\par months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else. He would      
\par be a wonderful study."                                                      
\par   "You don't mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you            
\par don't. If Dorian Gray's life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier          
\par than yourself. You are much better than you pretend to be."                 
\par   Lord Henry laughed. "The reason we all like to think so well of           
\par others is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of                
\par optimism is sheer terror. We think that we are generous because we          
\par credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are          
\par likely to be a benefit to us. We praise the banker that we may              
\par overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the highwayman in the      
\par hope that he may spare our pockets. I mean everything that I have           
\par said. I have the greatest contempt for optimism. As for a spoiled           
\par life, no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested. If you want      
\par to mar a nature, you have merely to reform it. As for marriage, of          
\par course that would be silly, but there are other and more interesting        
\par bonds between men and women. I will certainly encourage them. They          
\par have the charm of being fashionable. But here is Dorian himself. He         
\par will tell you more than I can."                                             
\par   "My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!"            
\par said the lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined            
\par wings, and shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn. "I have         
\par never been so happy. Of course it is sudden: all really delightful          
\par things are. And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been          
\par looking for all my life." He was flushed with excitement and pleasure,      
\par and looked extraordinarily handsome.                                        
\par   "I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian," said Hallward,            
\par "but I don't quite forgive you for not having let me know of your           
\par engagement. You let Harry know."                                            
\par   "And I don't forgive you for being late for dinner," broke in Lord        
\par Henry, putting his hand on the lad's shoulder, and smiling as he            
\par spoke. "Come, let us sit down and try what the new chef here is             
\par like, and then you will tell us how it all came about."                     
\par   "There is really not much to tell," cried Dorian, as they took their      
\par seats at the small round table. "What happened was simply this.             
\par After I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some              
\par dinner at that little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street, you              
\par introduced me to, and went down at eight o'clock to the theatre. Sibyl      
\par was playing Rosalind. Of course the scenery was dreadful, and the           
\par Orlando absurd. But Sibyl! You should have seen her! When she came          
\par on in her boy's clothes she was perfectly wonderful. She wore a             
\par moss-coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim brown               
\par cross-gartered hose, a dainty little green cap with a hawk's feather        
\par caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak lined with dull red. She had          
\par never seemed to me more exquisite. She had all the delicate grace of        
\par that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, Basil. Her hair         
\par clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose. As for         
\par her acting- well, you shall see her to-night. She is simply a born          
\par artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I forgot that         
\par I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away with my love      
\par in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the performance was            
\par over I went behind, and spoke to her. As we were sitting together,          
\par suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had never seen there        
\par before. My lips moved toward hers. We kissed each other. I can't            
\par describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to me that all        
\par my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured joy.        
\par She trembled all over, and shook like a white narcissus. Then she           
\par flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I feel that I should        
\par not tell you all this, but I can't help it. Of course our engagement        
\par is a dead secret. She has not even told her own mother. I don't know        
\par what my guardian will say. Lord Radley is sure to be furious. I             
\par don't care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and then I can do        
\par what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven't I, to take my love           
\par out of poetry, and to find my wife in Shakespeare's plays? Lips that        
\par Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear. I        
\par have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the           
\par mouth."                                                                     
\par   "Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right," said Hallward, slowly.           
\par   "Have you seen her to-day?" asked Lord Henry.                             
\par   Dorian Gray shook his head. "I left her in the forest of Arden, I         
\par shall find her in an orchard in Verona."                                    
\par   Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. "At what          
\par particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what        
\par did she say in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it."                    
\par   "My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and         
\par I did not make any formal proposal. I told her that I loved her, and        
\par she said she was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the             
\par whole world is nothing to me compared with her."                            
\par   "Women are wonderfully practical," murmured Lord Henry, "much more        
\par practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to        
\par say anything about marriage, and they always remind us."                    
\par   Hallward laid his hand upon his arm. "Don't, Harry. You have annoyed      
\par Dorian. He is not like other men. He would never bring misery upon any      
\par one, His nature is too fine for that."                                      
\par   Lord Henry looked across the table. "Dorian is never annoyed with         
\par me," he answered. "I asked the question for the best reason                 
\par possible, for the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any      
\par question- simply curiosity. I have a theory that it is always the           
\par women who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women.               
\par Except, of course, in the middle-class life. But then the middle            
\par classes are not modern."                                                    
\par   Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head. "You are quite                  
\par incorrigible, Harry; but I don't mind. It is impossible to be angry         
\par with you. When you see Sibyl Vane you will feel that the man who could      
\par wrong her would be a beast, a beast without a heart. I cannot               
\par understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he loves. I love         
\par Sibyl Vane. I want to place her on a pedestal of gold, and to see           
\par the world worship the woman who is mine. What is marriage? An               
\par irrevocable vow. You mock at it for that. Ah! don't mock. It is an          
\par irrevocable vow that I want to take. Her trust makes me faithful,           
\par her belief makes me good. When I am with her, I regret all that you         
\par have taught me. I become different from what you have known me to           
\par be. I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane's hand makes me          
\par forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous, delightful           
\par theories."                                                                  
\par   "And those are...?" asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.      
\par   "Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your             
\par theories about pleasure. All your theories, in fact, Harry."                
\par   "Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about," he              
\par answered, in his slow, melodious voice. "But I am afraid I cannot           
\par claim my theory as my own. It belongs to Nature, not to me. Pleasure        
\par is Nature's test, her sign of approval. When we are happy we are            
\par always good, but when we are good we are not always happy."                 
\par   "Ah! but what do you mean by good?" cried Basil Hallward.                 
\par   "Yes," echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair, and looking at Lord      
\par Henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in         
\par the centre of the table, "what do you mean by good, Harry?"                 
\par   "To be good is to be in harmony with one's self," he replied,             
\par touching the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed             
\par fingers. "Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others.             
\par One's own life- that is the important thing. As for the lives of one's      
\par neighbors, if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt          
\par one's moral views about them, but they are not one's concern. Besides,      
\par Individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in        
\par accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of         
\par culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest         
\par immorality."                                                                
\par   "But, surely, if one lives merely for one's self, Harry, one pays         
\par a terrible price for doing so?" suggested the painter.                      
\par   "Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays. I should fancy          
\par that the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing           
\par but self-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the             
\par privilege of the rich."                                                     
\par   "One has to pay in other ways but money."                                 
\par   "What sort of ways, Basil?"                                               
\par   "Oh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in... well, in the          
\par consciousness of degradation."                                              
\par   Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. "My dear fellow, mediaeval art is      
\par charming, but mediaeval emotions are out of date. One can use them          
\par in fiction, of course. But then the only things that one can use in         
\par fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact. Believe me,      
\par no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man            
\par ever knows what a pleasure is."                                             
\par   "I know what pleasure is," cried Dorian Gray. "It is to adore some        
\par one."                                                                       
\par   "That is certainly better than being adored," he answered, toying         
\par with some fruits. "Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just          
\par as Humanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are always bothering      
\par us to do something for them."                                               
\par   "I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first             
\par given to us," murmured the lad, gravely. "They create Love in our           
\par natures. They have a right to demand it back."                              
\par   "That is quite true, Dorian," cried Hallward.                             
\par   "Nothing is ever quite true," said Lord Henry.                            
\par   "This is," interrupted Dorian. "You must admit, Harry, that women         
\par give to men the very gold of their lives."                                  
\par   "Possibly," he sighed, "but they invariably want it back in such          
\par very small change. That is the worry. Women, as some witty Frenchman        
\par once put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces, and always      
\par prevent us from carrying them out."                                         
\par   "Harry, you are dreadful! I don't know why I like you so much."           
\par   "You will always like me, Dorian," he replied. "Will you have some        
\par coffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and fine-champagne, and          
\par some cigarettes. No; don't mind the cigarettes; I have some. Basil,         
\par I can't allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a cigarette. A             
\par cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is                  
\par exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want? Yes,      
\par Dorian, you will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins      
\par you have never had the courage to commit."                                  
\par   "What nonsense you talk, Harry!" cried the lad, taking a light            
\par from a fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on           
\par the table. "Let us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the          
\par stage you will have a new ideal of life. She will represent                 
\par something to you that you have never known."                                
\par   "I have known everything," said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his      
\par eyes, "but I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid,                
\par however, that, for me  at any rate, there is no such thing. Still,          
\par your wonderful girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more        
\par real than life. Let us go. Dorian, you will come with me. I am so           
\par sorry, Basil, but there is only room for two in the brougham, You must      
\par follow us in a hansom."                                                     
\par   They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing.        
\par The painter was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him. He      
\par could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better         
\par than many other things that might have happened. After a few                
\par minutes, they all passed downstairs. He drove off by himself, as had        
\par been arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little                
\par brougham in front of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. He         
\par felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been      
\par in the past. Life had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the      
\par crowded, flaring streets became blurred to his eyes. When the cab drew      
\par up at the theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older.          
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                              CHAPTER VII                                    
\par -                                                                           
\par   For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and           
\par the fat Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to        
\par ear with an oily, tremulous smile. He escorted them to their box            
\par with sort of pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands, and           
\par talking at the top of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than          
\par ever. He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met        
\par by Caliban. Lord Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him. At           
\par least he declared he did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand, and      
\par assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real      
\par genius and gone bankrupt over a poet. Hallward amused himself with          
\par watching the faces in the pit. The heat was terribly oppressive, and        
\par the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow      
\par fire. The youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and               
\par waistcoats and hung them over the side. They talked to each other           
\par across the theatre, and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who      
\par sat beside them. Some women were laughing in the pit. Their voices          
\par were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of the popping of corks      
\par came from the bar.                                                          
\par   "What a place to find one's divinity in!" said Lord Henry.                
\par   "Yes!" answered Dorian Gray. "It was here I found her, and she is         
\par divine beyond all living things. When she acts you will forget              
\par everything. These common, rough people, with their coarse faces and         
\par brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They      
\par sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to        
\par do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes             
\par them, and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's      
\par self."                                                                      
\par   "The same flesh and blood as one's self! Oh, I hope not!"                 
\par exclaimed Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery         
\par through his opera-glass.                                                    
\par   "Don't pay an attention to him, Dorian," said the painter. "I             
\par understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you love      
\par must be marvellous, and any girl that has the effect you describe must      
\par be fine and noble. To spiritualize one's age- that is something             
\par worth doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived           
\par without one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose          
\par lives have been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their             
\par selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own,         
\par she is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the         
\par world. This marriage is quite right. I did not think so at first,           
\par but I admit it now. The gods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her           
\par you would have been incomplete."                                            
\par   "Thanks, Basil," answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand. "I knew         
\par that you would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me.         
\par But here is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for      
\par about five minutes. Then the curtain rises, and you will see the            
\par girl to whom I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given           
\par everything that is good in me."                                             
\par   A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil          
\par of applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on the stage. Yes, she was                  
\par certainly, lovely to look at- one of the loveliest creatures, Lord          
\par Henry thought, that he had ever seen. There was something of the            
\par fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes. A faint blush, like the            
\par shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, came to her cheeks as she           
\par glanced at the crowded, enthusiastic house. She stepped back a few          
\par paces, and her lips seemed to tremble. Basil Hallward leaped to his         
\par feet and began to applaud. Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat           
\par Dorian Gray, gazing at her. Lord Henry peered through his glasses,          
\par murmuring, "Charming! charming!"                                            
\par   The scene was the hall of Capulet's house, and Romeo in his               
\par pilgrim's dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends. The        
\par band, such as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance          
\par began. Through the crowd of ungainly, shabbily-dressed actors, Sibyl        
\par Vane moved like a creature from a finer world. Her body swayed,             
\par while she danced, as a plant sways in the water. The curves of her          
\par throat were the curves of the white lily. Her hands seemed to be            
\par made of cool ivory.                                                         
\par   Yet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of love when           
\par her eyes rested on Romeo. The few words she had to speak-                   
\par -                                                                           
\par           Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,                    
\par             Which mannerly devotion shows in this'                          
\par           For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,              
\par             And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss-                         
\par -                                                                           
\par with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly           
\par artificial manner. The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view      
\par of tone it was absolutely false. It was wrong in colour. It took            
\par away all life from the verse. It made the passion unreal.                   
\par   Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. He was puzzled and anxious.      
\par Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to          
\par them to be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly disappointed.         
\par   Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony             
\par scene of the second act. They waited for that. If she failed there,         
\par there was nothing in her.                                                   
\par   She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. That could not      
\par be denied. But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew         
\par worse as she went on. Her gestures became absurdly artificial. She          
\par overemphasized everything that she had to say. The beautiful passage-       
\par -                                                                           
\par          Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,                      
\par          Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek                         
\par          For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night-                  
\par -                                                                           
\par was declaimed with the painful precision of a school-girl who has been      
\par taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When           
\par she leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines-              
\par -                                                                           
\par                       Although I joy in thee,                               
\par          I have no joy of this contract to-night;                           
\par          It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;                         
\par          Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be                     
\par          Ere one can say, "It lightens." Sweet, good-night!                 
\par          This bud of love by summer's ripening breath                       
\par          May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet-                    
\par -                                                                           
\par she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her. It           
\par was not nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was             
\par absolutely self-contained. It was simply bad art. She was a complete        
\par failure.                                                                    
\par   Even the common, uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost          
\par their interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk            
\par loudly and to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing, at the            
\par back of the dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only person      
\par unmoved was the girl herself.                                               
\par   When the second act was over there came a storm of hisses, and            
\par Lord Henry got up from his chair and put on His coat. "She is quite         
\par beautiful, Dorian," he said, "but she can't act. Let us go."                
\par   "I am going to see the play through," answered the lad, in a hard,        
\par bitter voice. "I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an             
\par evening, Harry. I apologize to you both."                                   
\par   "My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill," interrupted           
\par Hallward. "We will come some other night."                                  
\par   "I wish she were ill," he rejoined. "But she seems to me to be            
\par simply callous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she           
\par was a great artist. This evening she is merely a conmmon-place,             
\par mediocre actress."                                                          
\par   "Don't talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a more      
\par wonderful thing than Art."                                                  
\par   "They are both simply forms of imitation," remarked Lord Henry. "But      
\par do let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not          
\par good for one's morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don't suppose           
\par you will want your wife to act. So what does it matter if she plays         
\par Juliet like a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as          
\par little about life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful        
\par experience. There are only two kinds of people who are really               
\par fascinating- people who know absolutely everything, and people who          
\par know absolutely nothing. Good heavens, my dear boy, don't look so           
\par tragic! The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that      
\par is unbecoming. Come to the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke        
\par cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful.         
\par What more can you want?"                                                    
\par   "Go away, Harry," cried the lad. "I want to be alone. Basil, you          
\par must go. Ah! can't you see that my heart is breaking?" The hot tears        
\par came to his eyes. His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the         
\par box, he leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.           
\par   "Let us go, Basil," said Lord Henry, with a strange tenderness in         
\par his voice; and the two young men passed out together.                       
\par   A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up, and the curtain        
\par rose on the third act. Dorian Gray went back to his seat. He looked         
\par pale, and proud, and indifferent. The play ragged on, and seemed            
\par interminable. Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy              
\par boots, and laughing. The whole thing was a fiasco. The last act was         
\par played to almost empty benches. The curtain went down on a titter, and      
\par some groans.                                                                
\par   As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into         
\par the greenroom. The girl was standing there alone, with a look of            
\par triumph on her face. Her eyes lit with an exquisite fire. There was         
\par a radiance about her. Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of      
\par their own.                                                                  
\par   When he entered, she looked at him and an expression of infinite joy      
\par came over her. "How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!" she cried.             
\par   "Horribly!" he answered, gazing at her in amazement, "horribly! It        
\par was dreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You have no        
\par idea what I suffered."                                                      
\par   The girl smiled. "Dorian," she answered, lingering over his name          
\par with long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than          
\par honey to the red petals of her mouth- "Dorian, you should have              
\par understood. But you understand now, don't you?"                             
\par   "Understand what?" he asked angrily.                                      
\par   "Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall        
\par never act well again."                                                      
\par   He shrugged his shoulders. "You are ill, I suppose. When you are ill      
\par you shouldn't act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were            
\par bored. I was bored."                                                        
\par   She seemed not to listen to him. She was transfigured with joy. An        
\par ecstasy of happiness dominated her.                                         
\par   "Dorian, Dorian," she cried, "before I knew you, acting was the           
\par one reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I          
\par thought that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night, and Portia the      
\par other. The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia          
\par were mine also. I believed in everything. The common people who             
\par acted with me seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my        
\par world. I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You             
\par came- oh, my beautiful love!- and you freed my soul from prison. You        
\par taught me what reality really is. To-night, for the first time in my        
\par life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the          
\par empty pageant in which I had always played. To-night, for the first         
\par time, I became conscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and           
\par painted, and that the moonlight in the orchard was false, that the          
\par scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had to speak were unreal,          
\par were not my words, were not what I wanted to say. You had brought me        
\par something higher, something of which all art is but a reflection.           
\par You had made me understand what love really is. My love! my love!           
\par Prince Charming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of shadows. You are      
\par more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do with the             
\par puppets of a play? When I came on to-night, I could not understand how      
\par it was that everything had gone from me. I thought that I was going to      
\par be wonderful. I found that I could do nothing. Suddenly it dawned on        
\par my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to me. I             
\par heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love such as      
\par ours? Take me away, Dorian- take me away with you, where we can be          
\par quite alone. I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not        
\par feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian,           
\par Dorian, you understand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it,        
\par it would be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made      
\par me see that."                                                               
\par   He flung himself down on the sofa, and turned away his face. "You         
\par have killed my love," he muttered.                                          
\par   She looked at him in wonder, and laughed. He made no answer. She          
\par came across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair.           
\par She knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips. He drew them away,        
\par and a shudder ran through him.                                              
\par   Then he leaped up, and went to the door. "Yes," he cried, "you            
\par have killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don't         
\par even stir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you           
\par because you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect,          
\par because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and           
\par substance to the shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You           
\par are shallow and stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool      
\par I have been! You are nothing to me now. I will never see you again.         
\par I will never think of you. I will never mention your name. You don't        
\par know what you were to me, once. Why, once... Oh, I can't bear to think      
\par of it! I wish I had never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the          
\par romance of my life. How little you can know of love, if you say it          
\par mars your art! Without your art you are nothing. I would have made you      
\par famous, splendid, magnificent. The world would have worshipped you,         
\par and you would have borne my name. What are you now? A third-rate            
\par actress with a pretty face."                                                
\par   The girl grew white, and trembled. She clenched her hands                 
\par together, and her voice seemed to catch in her throat. "You are not         
\par serious, Dorian?" she murmured. "You are acting."                           
\par   "Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well," he answered,            
\par bitterly.                                                                   
\par   She rose from her knees, and, with a piteous expression of pain in        
\par her face, came across the room to him. She put her hand upon his            
\par arm, and looked into his eyes. He thrust her back. "Don't touch me!"        
\par he cried.                                                                   
\par   A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet, and         
\par lay there like a trampled flower. "Dorian, Dorian, don't leave me!"         
\par she whispered. "I am so sorry I didn't act well. I was thinking of you      
\par all the time. But I will try- indeed, I will try. It came so                
\par suddenly across me, my love for you. I think I should never have known      
\par it if you had not kissed me- if we had not kissed each other. Kiss          
\par me again, my love. Don't go away from me. I couldn't bear it. Oh!           
\par don't go away from me. My brother... No; never mind. He didn't mean         
\par it. He was in jest... But you, oh! can't you forgive me for                 
\par to-night? I will work so hard, and try to improve. Don't be cruel to        
\par me because I love you better than anything in the world. After all, it      
\par is only once that I have not pleased you. But you are quite right,          
\par Dorian. I should have shown myself more of an artist. It was foolish        
\par of me; and yet I couldn't help it. Oh, don't leave me, don't leave          
\par me." A fit of passionate sobbing choked her. She crouched on the floor      
\par like a wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked      
\par down at her, and his chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain. There      
\par is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one        
\par has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane seemed to him to be absurdly                 
\par melodromatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed him.                               
\par   "I am going," he said at last, in his calm, clear voice. "I don't         
\par wish to be unkind, but I can't see you again. You have disappointed         
\par me."                                                                        
\par   She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her              
\par little hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for          
\par him. He turned on his heel, and left the room. In a few moments he was      
\par out of the theatre.                                                         
\par   Where he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through          
\par dimly-lit streets, past gaunt black-shadowed archways and evil-looking      
\par houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after        
\par him. Drunkards had reeled by cursing, and chattering to themselves          
\par like monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon            
\par doorsteps, and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.                  
\par   As the dawn was just breaking he found himself close to Covent            
\par Garden. The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky         
\par hollowed itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding        
\par lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was           
\par heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to           
\par bring him an anodyne for His pain. He followed into the market, and         
\par watched the men unloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter             
\par offered him some cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he refused          
\par to accept any money for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They        
\par had been plucked at midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered      
\par into them. A long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips,           
\par and of yellow and red roses, defiled in front of him, threading             
\par their way through the huge jade-green piles of vegetables. Under the        
\par portico, with its grey sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of            
\par draggled bareheaded girls, waiting for the auction to be over.              
\par Others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee-house in the          
\par piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped and stamped upon the rough            
\par stones, shaking their bells and trappings. Some of the drivers were         
\par lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked, and pink-footed, the          
\par pigeons ran about picking up seeds.                                         
\par   After a little while, he hailed a hansom, and drove home. For a           
\par few moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent      
\par Square with its blank close-shuttered windows, and its staring blinds.      
\par The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened            
\par like silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of         
\par smoke was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the                   
\par nacre-coloured air.                                                         
\par   In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge's barge,            
\par that hung from the ceiling of the great oak-panelled hall of entrance,      
\par lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals      
\par of flame they seemed, trimmed with white fire. He turned them out,          
\par and, having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the        
\par library towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber          
\par on the ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had        
\par just had decorated for himself, and hung with some curious Renaissance      
\par tapestries that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby      
\par Royal. As he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the      
\par portrait Basil Hallward had painted of him. He started back as if in        
\par surprise. Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled.      
\par After he had taken the buttonhole out of his coat, he seemed to             
\par hesitate. Finally he came back, went over to the picture, and examined      
\par it. In the dim arrested light that struggled through the                    
\par cream-coloured silk blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little         
\par changed. The expression looked different. One would have said that          
\par there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth. It was certainly strange.        
\par   He turned round, and, walking to the window, drew up the blind.           
\par The bright dawn flooded the room, and swept the fantastic shadows into      
\par dusky corners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange expression        
\par that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger            
\par there, to be more intensified even. The quivering, ardent sunlight          
\par showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he         
\par been looking into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.           
\par   He winced, and taking up from the table an oval glass framed in           
\par ivory Cupids, one of Lord Henry's many presents to him, glanced             
\par hurriedly into its polished depths. No line like that warped his red        
\par lips. What did it mean?                                                     
\par   He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it        
\par again. There were no signs of any change when he looked into the            
\par actual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole                  
\par expression had altered. It was not a mere fancy of his own. The             
\par thing was horribly apparent.                                                
\par   He threw himself into a chair, and began to think. Suddenly there         
\par flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward's studio         
\par the day the picture had been finished. Yes, he remembered it                
\par perfectly. He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain           
\par young, and the portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be              
\par untarnished, and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his              
\par passions and his sins; that the painted image might be seared with the      
\par lines of suffering and thought, and that he might keep all the              
\par delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood.           
\par Surely his wish had not been fulfilled? Such things were impossible.        
\par It seemed monstrous even to think of them. And, yet, there was the          
\par picture before him, with the touch of cruelty in the mouth.                 
\par   Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl's fault, not his. He had      
\par dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he      
\par had thought her great. Then she had disappointed him. She had been          
\par shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over      
\par him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little           
\par child. He remembered with what callousness he had watched her. Why had      
\par he been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him? But          
\par he had suffered also. During the three terrible hours that the play         
\par had lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture.      
\par His life was well worth hers. She had marred him for a moment, if he        
\par had wounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited to            
\par bear sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only               
\par thought of their emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to          
\par have some one with whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told         
\par him that, and Lord Henry knew what women were. Why should he trouble        
\par about Sibyl Vane? She was nothing to him now.                               
\par   But the picture? What was he to say of that? It held the secret of        
\par his life, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own             
\par beauty. Would it teach him to loathe his own soul? Would he ever            
\par look at it again?                                                           
\par   No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The         
\par horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it.              
\par Suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck            
\par that makes men mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think      
\par so.                                                                         
\par   Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its           
\par cruel smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue        
\par eyes met his own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for        
\par the painted image of himself, came over him. It had altered already,        
\par and would alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and          
\par white roses would die. For every sin that he committed, a stain             
\par would fleck and wreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture,      
\par changed or unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of                 
\par conscience. He would resist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry         
\par any more- would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous          
\par theories that in Basil Hallward's garden had first stirred within           
\par him the passion for impossible things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane,      
\par make her amends, marry her, try to love her again. Yes, it was his          
\par duty to do so. She must have suffered more than he had. Poor child! He      
\par had been selfish and cruel to her. The fascination that she had             
\par exercised over him would return. They would be happy together. His          
\par life with her would be beautiful and pure.                                  
\par   He got up from his chair, and drew a large screen right in front          
\par of the portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. "How horrible!" he         
\par murmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it.      
\par When he stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The             
\par fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He          
\par thought only of Sibyl. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He        
\par repeated her name over and over again. The birds that were singing          
\par in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.      
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                              CHAPTER VIII                                   
\par -                                                                           
\par   It was long past noon when he awoke. His valet had crept several          
\par times on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had            
\par wondered what made his young master sleep so late. Finally his bell         
\par sounded, and Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of         
\par letters, on a small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the             
\par olive-satin curtains, with, their shimmering blue lining, that hung in      
\par front of the three tall windows.                                            
\par   "Monsieur has slept well this morning," he said, smiling.                 
\par   "What o'clock is it, Victor?" asked Dorian Gray, drowsily.                
\par   "One hour and a quarter, Monsieur."                                       
\par   How late it was! He sat up, and, having sipped some tea, turned over      
\par his letters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought          
\par by hand this morning. He hesitated for a moment, and then put it            
\par aside. The others he opened listlessly. They contained the usual            
\par collection of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views,      
\par programmes of charity concerts, and the like, that are showered on          
\par fashionable young men every morning during the season. There was a          
\par rather heavy bill, for a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set, that        
\par he had not yet had the courage to send on to his guardians, who were        
\par extremely old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in          
\par an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities; and there          
\par were several very courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street      
\par money-lenders offering to advance any sum of money at a moment's            
\par notice and at the most reasonable rates of interest.                        
\par   After about ten minutes he got up, and, throwing on an elaborate          
\par dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the            
\par onyx-paved bathroom. The cool water refreshed him after his long            
\par sleep. He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A dim      
\par sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or      
\par twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about it.                     
\par   As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down          
\par to a light French breakfast, that had been laid out for him on a small      
\par round table close to the open window. It was an exquisite day. The          
\par warm air seemed laden with spices. A bee flew in, and buzzed round the      
\par blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood              
\par before him. He felt perfectly happy.                                        
\par   Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of        
\par the portrait, and he started.                                               
\par   "Too cold for Monsieur?" asked his valet, putting an omelette on the      
\par table. "I shut the window?"                                                 
\par   Dorian shook his head. "I am not cold," he murmured.                      
\par   Was it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been          
\par simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil             
\par where there had been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could           
\par not alter? The thing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell           
\par Basil some day. It would make him smile.                                    
\par   And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing! First        
\par in the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the           
\par touch of cruelty round the warped lips. He almost dreaded his valet         
\par leaving the room. He knew that when he was alone he would have to           
\par examine the portrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the coffee           
\par and cigarettes had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a         
\par wild desire to tell him to remain. As the door was closing behind           
\par him he called him back. The man stood waiting for his orders. Dorian        
\par looked at him for a moment. "I am not at home to any one, Victor,"          
\par he said, with a sigh. The man bowed and retired.                            
\par   Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette and flung himself            
\par down on a luxuriously-cushioned couch that stood facing the screen.         
\par The screen was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and             
\par wrought with a rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned it          
\par curiously, wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a        
\par man's life.                                                                 
\par   Should he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there?            
\par What was the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible.        
\par If it was not true, why trouble about it? But what if, by some fate or      
\par deadlier chance, eyes other than his spied behind, and saw the              
\par horrible change? What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to      
\par look at his own picture? Basil would be sure to do that. No; the thing      
\par had to be examined, and at once. Anything would be better than this         
\par dreadful state of doubt.                                                    
\par   He got up, and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when he      
\par looked upon the mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside,           
\par and saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait           
\par had altered.                                                                
\par   As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small               
\par wonder, he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a             
\par feeling of almost scientific interest. That such a change should            
\par have taken place was incredible to him. And yet it was a fact. Was          
\par there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms, that shaped          
\par themselves into form and colour on the canvas, and the soul that was        
\par within him? Could it be that what that soul thought, they realized?-        
\par that what it dreamed, they made true? Or was there some other, more         
\par terrible reason? He shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the      
\par couch, lay there, gazing at the picture in sickened horror.                 
\par   One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had made         
\par him conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane. It was      
\par not too late to make reparation for that. She could still be his wife.      
\par His unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence,           
\par would be transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that        
\par Basil Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through           
\par life, would be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to           
\par others, and the fear of God to us all. There were opiates for remorse,      
\par drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible      
\par symbol of the degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the      
\par ruin men brought upon their souls.                                          
\par   Three o'clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double         
\par chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather up the         
\par scarlet threads of life, and to weave them into a pattern; to find his      
\par way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was          
\par wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he        
\par went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he         
\par had loved, imploring her forgiveness, and accusing himself of madness.      
\par He covered page after page with wild words of sorrow, and wilder words      
\par of pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves        
\par we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the                 
\par confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian           
\par had finished the letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.                 
\par   Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry's        
\par voice outside. "My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I           
\par can't bear your shutting yourself up like this."                            
\par   He made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking        
\par still continued, and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry      
\par in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to             
\par quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting      
\par was inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the            
\par picture, and unlocked the door.                                             
\par   "I am so sorry for it all, Dorian," said Lord Henry, as he                
\par entered. "But you must not think too much about it."                        
\par   "Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?" asked the lad.                            
\par   "Yes, of course," answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair, and          
\par slowly pulling off his yellow gloves. "It is dreadful, from one             
\par point of view, but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind        
\par and see her, after the play was over?"                                      
\par  "Yes."                                                                     
\par   "I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?"                     
\par   "I was brutal, Harry, perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I        
\par am not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to            
\par know myself better."                                                        
\par   "Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I         
\par would find you plunged in remorse, and tearing that nice curly hair of      
\par yours."                                                                     
\par   "I have got through all that," said Dorian, shaking his head, and         
\par smiling. "I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to           
\par begin with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest           
\par thing in us. Don't sneer at it, Harry, any more- at least not before        
\par me. I want to be good. I can't bear the idea of my soul being               
\par hideous."                                                                   
\par   "A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate        
\par you on it. But how are you going to begin?"                                 
\par   "By marrying Sibyl Vane."                                                 
\par   "Marrying Sibyl Vane! " cried Lord Henry, standing up, and looking        
\par at him in perplexed amazement. "But, my dear Dorian--"                      
\par   "Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful         
\par about marriage. Don't say it. Don't ever say things of that kind to me      
\par again. Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break      
\par my word to her. She is to be my wife."                                      
\par   "Your wife! Dorian!... Didn't you get my letter? I wrote to you this      
\par morning, and sent the note down, by my own man."                            
\par   "Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry.         
\par I was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn't like.           
\par You cut life to pieces with your epigrams."                                 
\par   "You know nothing, then?"                                                 
\par   "What do you mean?"                                                       
\par   Lord Henry walked across the room, and, sitting down by Dorian Gray,      
\par took both his hands in his own, and held them tightly. "Dorian," he         
\par said, "my letter- don't be frightened- was to tell you that Sibyl Vane      
\par is dead."                                                                   
\par   A cry of pain broke from the lad's lips, and he leaped to his             
\par feet, tearing his hands away from Lord Henry's grasp. "Dead! Sibyl          
\par dead! It is not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say it?"           
\par   "It is quite true, Dorian," said Lord Henry, gravely. "It is in           
\par all the morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see           
\par any one till I came. There will have to be an inquest, of course,           
\par and you must not be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man             
\par fashionable in Paris. But in London people are so prejudiced. Here,         
\par one should never make one's debut with a scandal. One should reserve        
\par that to give an interest to one's old age. I suppose they don't know        
\par your name at the theatre? If they don't, it is all right. Did any           
\par one see you going round to her room? That is an important point."           
\par   Dorian did not answer for a few moments. He was dazed with horror.        
\par Finally he stammered, in a stifled voice, "Harry, did you say an            
\par inquest? What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl--? Oh, Harry, I can't         
\par bear it! But be quick. Tell me everything at once."                         
\par   "I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be        
\par put in that way to the public. It seems that as she was leaving the         
\par theatre with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she         
\par had forgotten something upstairs. They waited some time for her, but        
\par she did not come down again. They ultimately found her lying dead on        
\par the floor of her dressing room. She had swallowed something by              
\par mistake, some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don't know what        
\par it was, but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should        
\par fancy it was prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously."      
\par   "Harry, Harry, it is terrible!" cried the lad.                            
\par   "Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself         
\par mixed up in it. I see by The Standard that she was seventeen. I should      
\par have thought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a            
\par child, and seemed to know so little about acting. Dorian, you               
\par mustn't let this thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with      
\par me, and afterwards we will look in at the Opera. It is a Patti              
\par night, and everybody will be there. You can come to my sister's box.        
\par She has got some smart women with her."                                     
\par   "So I have murdered Sibyl Vane," said Dorian Gray, half to                
\par himself, "murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat          
\par with a knife. Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that. The           
\par birds sing just as happily in my garden. And to-night I am to dine          
\par with you, and then go on to the Opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose,        
\par afterwards. How extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all         
\par this in a book, Harry, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now      
\par that it has happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful        
\par for tears. Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever             
\par written in my life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter           
\par should have been addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder,         
\par those white silent people we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she feel, or         
\par know, or listen? Oh, Harry, how I loved her once! It seems years ago        
\par to me now. She was everything to me. Then came that dreadful night-         
\par was it really only last night?- when she played so badly, and my heart      
\par almost broke. She explained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic.         
\par But I was not moved a bit. I thought her shallow. Suddenly something        
\par happened that made me afraid. I can't tell you what it was, but it was      
\par terrible. I said I would go back to her. I felt I had done wrong.           
\par And now she is dead. My God! my God! Harry, what shall I do? You don't      
\par know the danger I am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight. She      
\par would have done that for me. She had no right to kill herself. It           
\par was selfish of her."                                                        
\par   "My dear Dorian," answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his        
\par case, and producing a gold-latten matchbox, "the only way a woman           
\par can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all      
\par possible interest in life. If you had married this girl you would have      
\par been wretched. Of course you would have treated her kindly. One can         
\par always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would        
\par have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And        
\par when a woman finds that out about her husband, she either becomes           
\par dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart bonnets that some other               
\par woman's husband has to pay for. I say nothing about the social              
\par mistake, which would have been abject, which, of course, I would not        
\par have allowed, but I assure you that in any case the whole thing             
\par would have been an absolute failure."                                       
\par   "I suppose it would," muttered the lad, walking up and down the           
\par room, and looking horribly pale. "But I thought it was my duty. It          
\par is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what      
\par was right. I remember your saying once that there is a fatality             
\par about good resolutions- that they are always made too late. Mine            
\par certainly were."                                                            
\par   "Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with                  
\par scientific laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is               
\par absolutely nil. They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious         
\par sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak. That is all        
\par that can be said for them. They are simply cheques that men draw on         
\par a bank where they have no account."                                         
\par   "Harry," cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him,      
\par "why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I          
\par don't think I am heartless. Do you?"                                        
\par   "You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight          
\par to be entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian," answered Lord           
\par Henry, with his sweet, melancholy smile.                                    
\par   The lad frowned. "I don't like that explanation, Harry," he               
\par rejoined, "but I am glad you don't think I'm heartless. I am nothing        
\par of the kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing          
\par that has happened does not affect me as it should. It seems to me to        
\par be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all           
\par the terrible beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a         
\par great part, but by which I have not been wounded."                          
\par   "It is an interesting question," said Lord Henry, who found an            
\par exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism- "an         
\par extremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation is        
\par this. It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such        
\par an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence,             
\par their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire      
\par lack of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They            
\par give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against           
\par that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements        
\par of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the      
\par whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly        
\par we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the         
\par play. Or rather we are both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder        
\par of the spectacle enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that         
\par has really happened? Some one has killed herself for love of you. I         
\par wish that I had ever had such an experience. It would have made me          
\par in love with love for the rest of my life. The people who have              
\par adored me- there have not been very many, but there have been some-         
\par have always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for      
\par them, or they to care for me. They have become stout and tedious,           
\par and when I meet them they go in at once for reminiscences. That             
\par awful memory of woman! What a fearful thing it is! And what an utter        
\par intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb the colour of         
\par life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always         
\par vulgar."                                                                    
\par   "I must sow poppies in my garden," sighed Dorian.                         
\par   "There is no necessity," rejoined his companion. "Life has always         
\par poppies in her hands. Of course, now and then things linger. I once         
\par wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic      
\par mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did      
\par die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her proposing to               
\par sacrifice the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It      
\par fills one with the terror of eternity. Well- would you believe it?-         
\par a week ago, at Lady Hampshire's, I found myself seated at dinner            
\par next the lady in question, and she insisted on going over the whole         
\par thing again, and digging up the past, and raking up the future. I           
\par had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel. She dragged it out              
\par again, and assured me that I had spoiled her life, I am bound to state      
\par that she ate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But         
\par what a lack of taste she showed! The one charm of the past is that          
\par it is the past. But women never know when the curtain has fallen. They      
\par always want a sixth act, and as soon the interest of the play is            
\par entirely over they propose to continue it. If they were allowed             
\par their own way, every comedy would have a tragic ending, and every           
\par tragedy would culminate in a farce. They are charmingly artificial,         
\par but they have no sense of art. You are more fortunate than I am. I          
\par assure you, Dorian, that not one of the women I have known would            
\par have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you. Ordinary women always         
\par console themselves. Some of them do it by going in for sentimental          
\par colours. Never trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever her age may be,      
\par or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons. It always          
\par means that they have a history. Others find a great consolation in          
\par suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands. They flaunt      
\par their conjugal felicity in one's face, as if it were the most               
\par fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its mysteries have all         
\par the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and I can quite            
\par understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that        
\par one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all. Yes; there is         
\par really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life.           
\par Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one."                       
\par   "What is that, Harry?" said the lad, listlessly.                          
\par   "Oh, the obvious consolation. Taking some one else's admirer when         
\par one loses one's own. In good society that always whitewashes a              
\par woman. But really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been          
\par from all the women one meets! There is something to me quite beautiful      
\par about her death. I am glad I am living in a century when such               
\par wonders happen. They make one believe in the reality of the things          
\par we all play with, such as romance, passion, and love."                      
\par   "I was terribly cruel to her. You forget that."                           
\par   "I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty,            
\par more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We      
\par have emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their             
\par masters, all the same. They love being dominated. I am sure you were        
\par splendid. I have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can      
\par fancy how delightful you looked. And, after all, you said something to      
\par the me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be         
\par merely fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true, and it             
\par holds the key to everything."                                               
\par   "What was that, Harry?"                                                   
\par   "You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the                
\par heroines of romance- that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the      
\par other; that if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen."             
\par   "She will never come to life again now," muttered the lad, burying        
\par his face in his hands.                                                      
\par   "No, she will never come to life. She has played her last part.           
\par But you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room         
\par simply as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a         
\par wonderful scene from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl          
\par never really lived, and so she has never really died. To you at             
\par least she was always a dream, a phantom that flitted through                
\par Shakespeare's plays and left them lovelier for its presence, a reed         
\par through which Shakespeare's music sounded richer and more full of joy.      
\par The moment she touched actual life, she marred it, and it marred            
\par her, and so she passed away. Mourn for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes      
\par on your head because Cordelia was strangled. Cry out against Heaven         
\par because the daughter of Brabantio died. But don't waste your tears          
\par over Sibyl Vane. She was less real than they are."                          
\par   There was silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly,         
\par and with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden. The             
\par colours faded wearily out of things.                                        
\par   After some time Dorian Gray looked up. "You have explained me to          
\par myself, Harry," he murmured, with something of a sigh of relief. "I         
\par felt all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I          
\par could not express it to myself. How well you know me! But we will           
\par not talk again of what has happened. It has been a marvellous               
\par experience. That is all. I wonder if life has still in store for me         
\par anything as marvellous."                                                    
\par   "Life has everything in store for you, Dorian. There is nothing that      
\par you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do."           
\par   "But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled? What        
\par then?"                                                                      
\par   "Ah, then," said Lord Henry, rising to go, "then, my dear Dorian,         
\par you would have to fight for your victories. As it is, they are brought      
\par to you. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that           
\par reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful.        
\par We cannot spare you. And now you had better dress, and drive down to        
\par the club. We are rather late, as it is."                                    
\par   "I think I shall join you at the Opera, Harry. I feel too tired to        
\par eat anything. What is the number of your sister's box?"                     
\par   "Twenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see           
\par her name on the door. But I am sorry you won't come and dine."              
\par   "I don't feel up to it," said Dorian, listlessly. "But I am               
\par awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are            
\par certainly my best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have."       
\par   "We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian," answered        
\par Lord Henry, shaking him by the hand. "Good-bye. I shall see you before      
\par nine-thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is singing."                           
\par   As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell,           
\par and in a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the            
\par blinds down. He waited impatiently for him to go. The man seemed to         
\par take an interminable time over everything.                                  
\par   As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen, and drew it back.        
\par No; there was no further change in the picture. It had received the         
\par news of Sibyl Vane's death before he had known of it himself. It was        
\par conscious of the events of life as they occurred. The vicious               
\par cruelty that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt,              
\par appeared at the very moment that the girl had drunk the poison,             
\par whatever it was. Or was it indifferent to results? Did it merely            
\par take cognizance of what passed within the soul? He wondered, and hoped      
\par that some day he would see the change taking place before his very          
\par eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.                                            
\par   Poor Sibyl! what a romance it had all been! She had often mimicked        
\par death on the stage. Then Death himself had touched her, and taken           
\par her with him. How had she played that dreadful last scene, Had she          
\par cursed him, as she died? No; she had died for love of him, and love         
\par would always be a sacrament to him now. She had atoned for everything,      
\par by the sacrifice she had made of her life. He would not think any more      
\par of what she had made him go through, on that horrible night at the          
\par theatre. When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic          
\par figure sent on to the world's stage to show the supreme reality of          
\par Love. A wonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his eyes as he               
\par remembered her childlike look and winsome fanciful ways and shy             
\par tremulous grace. He brushed them away hastily, and looked again at the      
\par picture.                                                                    
\par   He felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or           
\par had his choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for            
\par him- life, and his own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth,        
\par infinite passion, pleasure subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder          
\par sins- he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the         
\par burden of his shame: that was all.                                          
\par   A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration         
\par that was in store for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish          
\par mockery of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted      
\par lips that now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning after morning he had        
\par sat before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of        
\par it, as it seemed to him at times. Was it to alter now with every            
\par mood to which he yielded? Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome        
\par thing, to be hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the          
\par sunlight that had so often touched to brighter gold the waving              
\par wonder of its hair? The pity of it! the pity of it!                         
\par   For a moment he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that        
\par existed between him and the picture might cease. It had changed in          
\par answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain           
\par unchanged. And, yet, who, that knew anything about Life, would              
\par surrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that      
\par chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be              
\par fraught? Besides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed            
\par been prayer that had produced the substitution? Might there not be          
\par some curious scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise        
\par its influence upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an         
\par influence upon dead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or           
\par conscious desire, might not things external to ourselves vibrate in         
\par unison with our moods and passions, atom calling to atom in secret          
\par love or strange affinity? But the reason was of no importance. He           
\par would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power. If the picture      
\par was to alter, it was to alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely        
\par into it?                                                                    
\par   For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be            
\par able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be      
\par to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his           
\par own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. And when winter came      
\par upon it, he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge      
\par of summer. When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a            
\par pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of         
\par boyhood. Not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one         
\par pulse of his life would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he        
\par would be strong, and fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what             
\par happened to the coloured image on the canvas? He would be safe. That        
\par was everything.                                                             
\par   He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the             
\par picture, smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where           
\par his valet was already waiting for him. An hour later he was at the          
\par Opera, and Lord Henry was leaning over his chair.                           
\par                                                                             
\par

\par -                                                                           
\par   As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was           
\par shown into the room.                                                        
\par   "I am glad I have found you, Dorian," he said gravely. "I called          
\par last night, and they told me you were at the Opera. Of course I knew        
\par that was impossible. But I wish you hid left word where you had really      
\par gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy          
\par might be followed by another. I think you might have telegraphed for        
\par me when you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a            
\par late edition of The Globe, that I picked up at the club. I came here        
\par at once, and was miserable at not finding you. I can't tell you how         
\par heartbroken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer.        
\par But where were you? Did you go down and see the girl's mother? For a        
\par moment I thought of following you there. They gave the address in           
\par the paper. Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn't it? But I was afraid of      
\par intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten. Poor woman! What a        
\par state she must be in! And her only child, too! What did she say             
\par about it all?"                                                              
\par   "My dear Basil, how do I know?" murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some        
\par pale-yellow wine from a delicate gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass,      
\par and looking dreadfully bored. "I was at the Opera. You should have          
\par come on there. met Lady Gwendolyn, Harry's sister, for the first time.      
\par We were in her box. She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang               
\par divinely. Don't talk about horrid subjects. If one doesn't talk             
\par about a thing, it has never happened. It is simply expression, as           
\par Harry says, that gives reality to things. I may mention that she was        
\par not the woman's only child. There is a son, a charming fellow, I            
\par believe. But he is not on the stage. He is a sailor, or something. And      
\par now, tell me about yourself and what you are painting."                     
\par   "You went to the Opera?" said Hallward, speaking very slowly, and         
\par with a strained touch of pain in his voice. "You went to the Opera          
\par while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging? You can talk        
\par to me of other women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely,         
\par before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in?        
\par Why, man, there are horrors in store for that little white body of          
\par hers!"                                                                      
\par   "Stop, Basil! I won't hear it!" cried Dorian, leaping to his feet.        
\par "You must not tell me about things. What is done is done. What is past      
\par is past."                                                                   
\par   "You call yesterday the past?"                                            
\par   "What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only          
\par shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who        
\par is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a          
\par pleasure. I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to         
\par use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them."                             
\par   "Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You      
\par look exactly like the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to        
\par come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple,         
\par natural, and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature        
\par in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk      
\par as if you had no heart, no pity in you. It is all Harry's influence. I      
\par see that."                                                                  
\par   The lad flushed up, and, going to the window, looked out for a few        
\par moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden. "I owe a great         
\par deal to Harry, Basil," he said, at last, "more than I owe to you.           
\par You only taught me to be vain."                                             
\par   "Well, I am punished for that, Dorian- or shall be some day."             
\par   "I don't know what you mean, Basil," he exclaimed, turning round. "I      
\par don't know what you want. What do you want?"                                
\par   "I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint," said the artist, sadly.         
\par   "Basil," said the lad, going over to him, and putting his hand on         
\par his shoulder, "you have come too late. Yesterday when I heard that          
\par Sibyl Vane had killed herself--"                                            
\par   "Killed herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?"             
\par cried Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.             
\par   "My dear Basil! Surely you don't think it was a vulgar accident?          
\par Of course she killed herself."                                              
\par   The elder man buried his face in his hands. "How fearful," he             
\par muttered, and a shudder ran through him.                                    
\par   "No," said Dorian Gray, "there is nothing fearful about it. It is         
\par one of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people           
\par who act lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or         
\par faithful wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean-                 
\par middle-class virtue, and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl        
\par was! She lived her finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The            
\par last night she played- the night you saw her- she acted badly               
\par because she had known, the reality of love. When she knew its               
\par unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died. She passed again            
\par into the sphere of art. There is something of the martyr about her.         
\par Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its            
\par wasted beauty. But as I was saying, you must not think I have not           
\par suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment- about        
\par half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six- you would have found          
\par me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the news, in          
\par fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered immensely. Then      
\par it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except              
\par sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come down here      
\par to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled, and           
\par you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a          
\par story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty         
\par years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some        
\par unjust law altered- I forget exactly what it was. Finally he                
\par succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had              
\par absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui, and became a confirmed      
\par misanthrope. And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to          
\par console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see          
\par it from a proper artistic point of view. Was it not Gautier who used        
\par to write about la consolation des arts? I remember picking up a little      
\par vellum-covered book in our studio one day and chancing on that              
\par delightful phrase. Well, I am not like that young man you told me of        
\par when we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to say         
\par that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life. I         
\par love beautiful things that one can touch and handle. Old brocades,          
\par green bronzes, lacquerwork, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings,         
\par luxury, pomp, there is much to be got from all these. But the artistic      
\par temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more          
\par to me. To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to      
\par escape the suffering of life. I know you are surprised at my talking        
\par to you like this. You have not realized how I have developed. I was         
\par a schoolboy when you knew me. I am a man now. I have new passions, new      
\par thoughts, new ideas. I am different, but you must not like me less.         
\par I am changed, but you must always be my friend. Of course I am very         
\par fond of Harry. But I know that you are better than he is. You are           
\par not stronger- you are too much afraid of life- but you are better. And      
\par how happy we used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, and don't          
\par quarrel with me. I am what I am. There is nothing more to be said."         
\par   The painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to          
\par him, and his personality had been the great turning-point in his            
\par art. He could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more. After          
\par all, his indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away.      
\par There was so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.      
\par   "Well, Dorian," he said, at length, with a sad smile, "I won't speak      
\par to you again about this horrible thing, after to-day. I only trust          
\par your name won't be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is          
\par to take place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?"                      
\par   Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his            
\par face at the mention of the word "inquest." There was something so           
\par crude and vulgar about everything of the kind. "They don't know my          
\par name," he answered.                                                         
\par   "But surely she did?"                                                     
\par   "Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never               
\par mentioned to any one. She told me once that they were all rather            
\par curious to learn who I was, and that she invariably told them my            
\par name was Prince Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a            
\par drawing of Sibyl, Basil. I should like to have something more of her        
\par than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words."            
\par   "I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. But         
\par you must come and sit to me yourself again. I can't get on without          
\par you."                                                                       
\par   "I can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!" he               
\par exclaimed, starting back.                                                   
\par   The painter stared at him. "My dear boy, what nonsense!" he cried.        
\par "Do you mean to say you don't like what I did for you? Where is it?         
\par Why, have you pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look at it?          
\par It is the best thing I have ever done. Do take the screen away,             
\par Dorian. It is simply, disgraceful of your servant hiding my work            
\par like that. I felt the room looked different as I came in."                  
\par   "My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don't imagine I         
\par let him arrange my room for me? He settles my flowers for me                
\par sometimes- that is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too              
\par strong on the portrait."                                                    
\par   "Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable place         
\par for it. Let me see it." And Hallward walked towards the corner of           
\par the room.                                                                   
\par   A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray's lips, and he rushed between      
\par the painter and the screen. "Basil," he said, looking very pale,            
\par "you must not look at it. I don't wish you to."                             
\par   "Not look at my own work! you are not serious. Why shouldn't I            
\par look at it?" exclaimed Hallward, laughing.                                  
\par   "If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will             
\par never speak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I           
\par don't offer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But,           
\par remember, if you touch this screen, everything is over between us."         
\par   Hallward was thunderstruck. He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute          
\par amazement. He had never seen him like this before. The lad was              
\par actually pallid with rage. His hands were clenched, and the pupils          
\par of his eyes were like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all over.        
\par   "Dorian!"                                                                 
\par   "Don't speak!"                                                            
\par   "But what is the matter? Of course I won't look at it if you don't        
\par want me to," he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel, and going         
\par over towards the window. "But, really, it seems rather absurd that I        
\par shouldn't see my own work. especially as I am going to exhibit it in        
\par Paris in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it another coat          
\par of varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not              
\par to-day?"                                                                    
\par   "To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it;" exclaimed Dorian Gray, a         
\par strange sense of terror creeping over him. Was the world going to be        
\par shown his secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his life? That      
\par was impossible. Something- he did not know what- had to be done at          
\par once.                                                                       
\par   "Yes; I don't suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is           
\par going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in           
\par the Rue de Seze, which will open the first week in October. The             
\par portrait will only be away a month. I should think you could easily         
\par spare it for that time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town. And        
\par if you keep it always behind a screen, you can't care much about it."       
\par   Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads of        
\par perspiration there. He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible          
\par danger. "You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,"          
\par he cried. "Why have you changed your mind? You people who go in for         
\par being consistent have just as many moods as others have. The only           
\par difference is that your moods are rather meaningless. You can't have        
\par forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the             
\par world would induce you to send it to any exhibition. You told Harry         
\par exactly the same thing." He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light          
\par came into his eyes. He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him           
\par once, half seriously, and half in jest, "If you want to have a strange      
\par quarter of an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won't exhibit your         
\par picture. He told me why he wouldn't, and it was a revelation to me."        
\par Yes, perhaps, Basil, too, had his secret. He would ask him and try.         
\par   "Basil," he said, coming over quite close, and looking him                
\par straight in the face, "we have each of us a secret. Let me know yours,      
\par and I shall tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to             
\par exhibit my picture?"                                                        
\par   The painter shuddered in spite of himself. "Dorian, if I told you,        
\par you might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at        
\par me. I could not bear your doing either of those two things. If you          
\par wish me never to look at your picture again, I am content. I have           
\par always you to look at. If you wish the best work I have ever done to        
\par be hidden from the world, I am satisfied. Your friendship is dearer to      
\par me than any fame or reputation."                                            
\par   "No, Basil, you must tell me," insisted Dorian Gray. "I think I have      
\par a right to know." His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity      
\par had taken its place. He was determined to find out Basil Hallward's         
\par mystery.                                                                    
\par   "Let us sit down, Dorian," said the painter, looking troubled.            
\par "Let us sit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed in      
\par the picture something curious?- something that probably at first did        
\par not strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?"                  
\par   "Basil!" cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with              
\par trembling hands, and gazing at him with wild, startled eyes.                
\par   "I see you did. Don't speak. Wait till you hear what I have to            
\par say. Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the            
\par most extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain,         
\par and power by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that          
\par unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I      
\par worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I            
\par wanted to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with          
\par you. When you were away from me you were still present in my art....        
\par Of course I never let you know anything about this. It would have been      
\par impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it        
\par myself. I only, knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that      
\par the world had become wonderful to my eyes- too wonderful, perhaps, for      
\par in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less      
\par than the peril of keeping them.... Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew      
\par more and more absorbed in you. Then came a new development. I had           
\par drawn you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman's          
\par cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you        
\par had sat on the prow of Adrian's barge, gazing across the green              
\par turbid Nile. You had leaned over the still pool of some Greek               
\par woodland, and seen in the water's silent silver the marvel of your own      
\par face. And it had all been what art should be, unconscious, ideal,           
\par and remote. One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I determined to         
\par paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are, not in the           
\par costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your own time.           
\par Whether it was the Realism of the method or the mere wonder of your         
\par own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or veil, I      
\par cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at it, every flake and film        
\par of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. I grew afraid that              
\par others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that I had told           
\par too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it was            
\par that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You were a      
\par little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to           
\par me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not          
\par mind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I        
\par felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my          
\par studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of      
\par its presence it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that      
\par I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely                
\par good-looking and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling         
\par that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation        
\par is ever really shown in the work one creates. Art is always more            
\par abstract than we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colour-         
\par that is all. It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far          
\par more completely than it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer      
\par from Paris I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in        
\par my exhibition. It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see         
\par now that you were right. The picture cannot be shown. You must not          
\par be angry with me, Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to            
\par Harry, once, you are made to be worshipped."                                
\par   Dorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his               
\par cheeks, and a smile played about his lips. The peril was over. He           
\par was safe for the time. Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for      
\par the painter who had just made this strange confession to him, and           
\par wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality        
\par of a friend. Lord Henry had the charm of being very dangerous. But          
\par that was all. He was too clever and too cynical to be really fond           
\par of. Would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange          
\par idolatry? Was that one of the things that life had in store?                
\par   "It is extraordinary, to me, Dorian," said Hallward, "that you            
\par should have seen this in the portrait. Did you really see it?"              
\par   "I saw something in it," he answered, "something that seemed to me        
\par very curious."                                                              
\par   "Well, you don't mind my looking at the thing now?"                       
\par   Dorian shook his head. "You must not ask me that, Basil. I could not      
\par possibly let you stand in front of that picture."                           
\par   "You will some day, surely?"                                              
\par   "Never."                                                                  
\par   "Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, Dorian. You have          
\par been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art.            
\par Whatever I have done that is good, I owe to you. Ah! you don't know         
\par what it cost me to tell you all that I have told you."                      
\par   "My dear Basil," said Dorian, "what have you told me? Simply that         
\par you felt that you admired me too much. That is not even a compliment."      
\par   "It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now            
\par that I have made it, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps        
\par one should never put one's worship into words."                             
\par   "It was a disappointing confession."                                      
\par   "Why, what did you expect, Dorian? You didn't see anything else in        
\par the picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?"                       
\par   "No; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you               
\par mustn't talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends,           
\par Basil, and we must always remain so."                                       
\par   "You have got Harry," said the painter, sadly.                            
\par   "Oh, Harry,?" cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. "Harry            
\par spends his days in saying what is incredible, and his evenings in           
\par doing what is improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to             
\par lead. But still I don't think I would go to Harry if I were in              
\par trouble. I would sooner go to you, Basil."                                  
\par   "You will sit to me again?"                                               
\par   "Impossible!"                                                             
\par   "You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man came          
\par across two ideal things. Few come across one."                              
\par   "I can't explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you            
\par again. There is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of its      
\par own. I will come and have tea with you. That will be just as                
\par pleasant."                                                                  
\par   "Pleasanter for you, I am afraid," murmured Hallward, regretfully.        
\par "And now good-bye. I am sorry you won't let me look at the picture          
\par once again. But that can't be helped. I quite understand what you feel      
\par about it."                                                                  
\par   As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil!           
\par how little he knew of the true reason! And how strange it was that,         
\par instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had              
\par succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend! How      
\par much that strange confession explained to him! The painter's absurd         
\par fits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his        
\par curious reticences- he understood them all now, and he felt sorry.          
\par There seemed to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured      
\par by romance.                                                                 
\par   He sighed and touched a bell. The portrait must be hidden away at         
\par all costs. He could not run such a risk of discovery again. It had          
\par been mad of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour,      
\par in a room to which any of his friends had access.                           
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                               CHAPTER X                                     
\par -                                                                           
\par   When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered      
\par if he had thought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite           
\par impassive, and waited for his orders. Dorian lit a cigarette, and           
\par walked over to the glass and glanced into it. He could see the              
\par reflection of Victor's face perfectly. It was like a placid mask of         
\par servility. There was nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet he thought it      
\par best to be on his guard.                                                    
\par   Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the housekeeper that he         
\par wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to         
\par send two of his men round at once. It seemed to him that as the man         
\par left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen. Or was      
\par that merely his own fancy?                                                  
\par   After a few moments, in her black silk dress with old-fashioned           
\par thread mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the            
\par library. He asked for the key of the schoolroom.                            
\par   "The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian," she exclaimed. "Why, it is full of      
\par dust. I must get it arranged, and put it straight before you go into        
\par it. It is not fit for you to see, sir. It is not, indeed."                  
\par   "I don't want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key."                
\par   "Well, sir, you'll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it. Why,        
\par it hasn't been opened for nearly five years, not since his lordship         
\par died."                                                                      
\par   He winced at the mention of his grandfather. He had hateful memories      
\par of him. "That does not matter," he answered. "I simply want to see the      
\par place- that is all. Give me the key."                                       
\par   "And here is the key, sir," said the old lady, going over the             
\par contents of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. "Here is the        
\par key. I'll have it off the bunch in a moment. But you don't think of         
\par living up there, sir, and you so comfortable here?"                         
\par   "No, no," he cried, petulantly. "Thank you, Leaf. That will do."          
\par   She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail        
\par of the household. He sighed, and told her to manage things as she           
\par thought best. She left the room, wreathed in smiles.                        
\par   As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket, and looked          
\par round the room. His eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet               
\par heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late                     
\par seventeenth-century Venetian work that his grandfather had found it         
\par a convent near Bologna. Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful          
\par thing in. It had perhaps served often as a pall for the dead. Now it        
\par was to hide something that had a corruption of its own, worse than the      
\par corruption of death itself- something that would breed horrors and yet      
\par would never die. What the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to      
\par the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat         
\par its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the          
\par thing would still live on. It would be always alive.                        
\par   He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told          
\par Basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away.           
\par Basil would have helped him to resist Lord Henry's influence, and           
\par the still more poisonous influences that came from his own                  
\par temperament. The love that he bore him- for it was really love- had         
\par nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual. It was not that          
\par mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses, and          
\par that dies when the senses tire. It was such love as Michael Angelo had      
\par known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself. Yes,        
\par Basil could have saved him. But it was too late now. The past could         
\par always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that.      
\par But the future was inevitable. There were passions in him that would        
\par find their terrible outlet, dreams that would make the shadow of their      
\par evil real.                                                                  
\par   He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that          
\par covered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen.         
\par Was the face on the canvas viler than before, it seemed to him that it      
\par was unchanged; and yet his loathing of it was intensified. Gold             
\par hair, blue eyes, and rose-red lips- they all were there. It was simply      
\par the expression that had altered. That was horrible in its cruelty.          
\par Compared to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow             
\par Basil's reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!- how shallow, and of          
\par what little account! His own soul was looking out at him from the           
\par canvas and calling him to judgment. A look of pain came across him,         
\par and he flung the rich pall over the picture. As he did so, a knock          
\par came to the door. He passed out as his servant entered.                     
\par   "The persons are here, Monsieur."                                         
\par   He felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be           
\par allowed to know where the picture was being taken to. There was             
\par something sly about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes.           
\par Sitting down at the writing-table, he scribbled a note to Lord              
\par Henry, asking him to send him round something to read, and reminding        
\par him that they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening.                   
\par   "Wait for an answer," he said, handing it to him, "and show the           
\par men in here."                                                               
\par   In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard          
\par himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in         
\par with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a            
\par florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was              
\par considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the        
\par artists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never left his shop. He           
\par waited for people to come to him. But he always made an exception in        
\par favor of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that charmed         
\par everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him.                               
\par   "What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?" he said, rubbing his fat freckled      
\par hands. "I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in           
\par person. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked it up at a         
\par sale. Came from Fonthill, I believe. Admirably suited for a                 
\par religious subject, Mr. Gray."                                               
\par   "I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming              
\par round, Mr. Hubbard. I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame-        
\par though I don't go in much at present for religious art- but to-day,         
\par I only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me. It is         
\par rather heavy, so I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your      
\par men."                                                                       
\par   "No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any service to      
\par you. Which is the work of art, sir?"                                        
\par   "This," replied Dorian, moving the screen back. "Can you move it,         
\par covering and all, just as it is? I don't want it to get scratched           
\par going upstairs."                                                            
\par   "There will be no difficulty, sir," said the genial frame-maker,          
\par beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from        
\par the long brass chains by which it was suspended. "And, now, where           
\par shall we carry it to, Mr. Gray?"                                            
\par   "I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me.      
\par Or perhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right at           
\par the top of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is        
\par wider."                                                                     
\par   He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall         
\par and began the ascent. The elaborate character of the frame had made         
\par the picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the              
\par obsequious protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman's            
\par spirited dislike of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian        
\par put his hand to it so as to help them.                                      
\par   "Something of a load to carry, sir," gasped the little man, when          
\par they reached the top landing. And he wiped his shiny forehead.              
\par   "I am afraid it is rather heavy," murmured Dorian, as he unlocked         
\par the door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the             
\par curious secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.          
\par   He had not entered the place for more than four years- not,               
\par indeed, since he had used it first as a playroom when he was a              
\par child, and then as a study when he grew somewhat older. It was a            
\par large, well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the        
\par last Lord Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his            
\par strange likeness to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had          
\par always hated and desired to keep at a distance. It appeared to              
\par Dorian to have but little changed. There was the huge Italian cassone,      
\par with its fantastically-painted panels and its tarnished gilt                
\par mouldings, in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy. There the      
\par satinwood bookcase filled with his dog-eared schoolbooks. On the            
\par wall behind it was hanging the same ragged Flemish tapestry where a         
\par faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden, while a company        
\par of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted               
\par wrists. How well he remembered it all! Every moment of his lonely           
\par childhood came back to him as he looked round. He recalled the              
\par stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed horrible to him          
\par that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden away. How              
\par little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in store         
\par for him!                                                                    
\par   But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes      
\par as this. He had the key, and no one else could enter it. Beneath its        
\par purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial,             
\par sodden, and unclean. What did it matter? No one could see it. He            
\par himself would not see it. Why should he watch the hideous corruption        
\par of his soul? He kept his youth- that was enough. And, besides, might        
\par not his nature grow finer, after all? There was no reason that the          
\par future should be so full of shame. Some love might come across his          
\par life, and purify him, and shield him from those sins that seemed to be      
\par already stirring in spirit and in flesh- those curious unpictured sins      
\par whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm.                
\par Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would have passed away from the           
\par scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to the world Basil               
\par Hallward's masterpiece.                                                     
\par   No; that was impossible. Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing        
\par upon the canvas was growing old. It might escape the hideousness of         
\par sin, but the hideousness of age was in store for it. The cheeks             
\par would become hollow or flaccid. Yellow crow's-feet would creep round        
\par the fading eyes and make them horrible. The hair would lose its             
\par brightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be foolish or              
\par gross, as the mouths of old men are. There would be the wrinkled            
\par throat, the cold, blue-veined hands, the twisted body, that he              
\par remembered in the grandfather who had been so stern to him in his           
\par boyhood. The picture had to be concealed. There was no help for it.         
\par   "Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please," he said, wearily, turning round.      
\par "I am sorry I kept you waiting so long. I was thinking of something         
\par else."                                                                      
\par   "Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray," answered the frame-maker,         
\par who was still gasping for breath. "Where shall we put it, sir?"             
\par   "Oh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I don't want to have it hung           
\par up. Just lean it against the wall. Thanks."                                 
\par   "Might one look at the work of art, sir?"                                 
\par   Dorian started. "It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard," he said,        
\par keeping his eye on the man. He felt ready to leap upon him and fling        
\par him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that             
\par concealed the secret of his life. "I shan't trouble you any more            
\par now. I am much obliged for your kindness in coming round."                  
\par   "Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. Ever ready to do anything for          
\par you, sir." And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the              
\par assistant, who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his      
\par rough, uncomely face. He had never seen any one so marvellous.              
\par   When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the        
\par door, and put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one would         
\par ever look upon the horrible thing. No eye but his would ever see his        
\par shame.                                                                      
\par   On reaching the library he found that it was just after five              
\par o'clock, and that the tea had been already brought up. On a little          
\par table of dark perfumed wood thickly encrusted with nacre, a present         
\par from Lady Radley, his guardian's wife, a pretty professional                
\par invalid, who had spent the preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note      
\par from Lord Henry, and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper, the        
\par cover slightly torn and the edges soiled. A copy of the third               
\par edition of The St. James Gazette had been placed on the tea-tray. It        
\par was evident that Victor had returned. He wondered if he had met the         
\par men in the hall as they were leaving the house, and had wormed out          
\par of them what they had been doing. He would be sure to miss the              
\par picture- had no doubt missed it already, while he had been laying           
\par the tea-things. The screen had not been set back, and a blank space         
\par was visible on the wall. Perhaps some night he might find him creeping      
\par upstairs and trying to force the door of the room. It was a horrible        
\par thing to have a spy in one's house. He had heard of rich men who had        
\par been blackmailed all their lives by some servant who had read a             
\par letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked up a card with an            
\par address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower or a shred of          
\par crumpled lace.                                                              
\par   He sighed, and, having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord           
\par Henry's note. It was simply to say, that he sent him round the evening      
\par paper, and book that might interest him, and that he would be at the        
\par club at eight-fifteen. He opened The St. James languidly, and looked        
\par through it. A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye. It          
\par drew attention to the following paragraph:                                  
\par   "INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.- An inquest was held this morning at the          
\par Bell Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the        
\par body of Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal           
\par Theatre, Holborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned.          
\par Considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased,         
\par who was greatly affected during the giving of her own evidence and          
\par that of Dr. Birrell, who had made the postmortem examination of the         
\par deceased."                                                                  
\par   He frowned, and, tearing the paper in two went across the room and        
\par flung the pieces away. How ugly it all was! And how horribly real           
\par ugliness made things! He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for          
\par having sent him the report. And it was certainly stupid of him to have      
\par marked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The man knew          
\par more than enough English for that.                                          
\par   Perhaps he had read it, and had begun to suspect something. And,          
\par yet, what did it matter, What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl              
\par Vane's death? There was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed         
\par her.                                                                        
\par   His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him. What        
\par was it, he wondered. He went towards the little pearl-coloured              
\par octagonal stand, that had always looked to him like the work of some        
\par strange Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the             
\par volume, flung himself into an armchair, and began to turn over the          
\par leaves. After a few minutes he became absorbed. It was the strangest        
\par book that he had ever read. It seemed to him that in exquisite              
\par raiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world         
\par were passing in dumb show before him. Things that he had dimly dreamed      
\par of were suddenly made real to him. Things of which he had never             
\par dreamed were gradually revealed.                                            
\par   It was a novel without a plot, and with only one character, being         
\par indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian,           
\par who spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the      
\par passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except         
\par his own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods            
\par through which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their            
\par mere artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called        
\par virtue, as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call        
\par sin. The style in which it was written was that curious jewelled            
\par style, vivid and obscure at once, full of argot and of archaisms, of        
\par technical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes      
\par the work of some of the finest artists of the French school of              
\par Symbolistes. There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids, and        
\par as subtle in colour. The life of the senses was described in the terms      
\par of mystical philosophy. One hardly knew at times whether one was            
\par reading the spiritual ecstasies of some mediaeval saint or the              
\par morbid confessions of a modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The         
\par heavy odor of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble        
\par the brain. The mere cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of        
\par their music, so full as it was of complex refrains and movements            
\par elaborately repeated, produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed         
\par from chapter to chapter, a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that      
\par made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows.               
\par   Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky           
\par gleamed through the windows. He read on by its wan light till he could      
\par read no more. Then, after his valet had reminded him several times          
\par of the lateness of the hour, he got up, and, going into the next room,      
\par placed the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at         
\par his bedside, and began to dress for dinner.                                 
\par   It was almost nine o'clock before he reached the club, where he           
\par found Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much      
\par bored.                                                                      
\par   "I am so sorry, Harry," he cried, "but really it is entirely your         
\par fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the         
\par time was going."                                                            
\par   "Yes: I thought you would like it," replied his host, rising from         
\par his chair.                                                                  
\par   "I didn't say I liked it, Harry. I said it fascinated me. There is a      
\par great difference."                                                          
\par   "Ah, you have discovered that?" murmured Lord Henry. And they passed      
\par into the dining-room.                                                       
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                               CHAPTER XI                                    
\par -                                                                           
\par   For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence          
\par of this book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he           
\par never sought to free himself from it. He procured from Paris no less        
\par than nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them             
\par bound in different colours, so that they might suit his various             
\par moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at         
\par times, to have almost entirely lost control. The hero, the wonderful        
\par young Parisian, in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments        
\par were so strangely blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of      
\par himself. And, indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the           
\par story of his own life, written before he had lived it.                      
\par   In one point he was more fortunate than the novel's fantastic             
\par hero. He never knew- never, indeed, had any cause to know- that             
\par somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces,           
\par and still waters, which came upon the young Parisian so early in his        
\par life, and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beauty that had           
\par once, apparently, been so remarkable. It was with an almost cruel joy-      
\par and perhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure,            
\par cruelty has its place- that he used to read the latter part of the          
\par book, with its really tragic, if somewhat over-emphasized, account          
\par of the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in               
\par others, and in the world, he had most dearly valued.                        
\par   For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward,           
\par and many others besides him, seemed never to leave him. Even those who      
\par had heard the most evil things against him, and from time to time           
\par strange rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became      
\par the chatter of the clubs, could not believe anything to his                 
\par dishonour when they saw him. He had always the look of one who had          
\par kept himself unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became        
\par silent when Dorian Gray entered the room. There was something in the        
\par purity of his face that rebuked them. His mere presence seemed to           
\par recall to them the memory of the innocence that they had tarnished.         
\par They wondered how one so charming and graceful as he was could have         
\par escaped the stain of an age that was at once sordid and sensual.            
\par   Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and                 
\par prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among          
\par those who were his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself        
\par would creep upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key         
\par that never left him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the          
\par portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the         
\par evil and aging face on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that      
\par laughed back at him from the polished glass. The very sharpness of the      
\par contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and            
\par more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the           
\par corruption of his own soul. He would examine with minute care, and          
\par sometimes with monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines            
\par that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual      
\par mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs          
\par of sin or the signs of age. He would place his white hands beside           
\par the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile. He mocked the           
\par misshapen body and the failing limbs.                                       
\par   There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his        
\par own delicately-scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little         
\par ill-famed tavern near the Docks, which, under an assumed name, and          
\par in disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the            
\par ruin he had brought upon his soul, with a pity that was all the more        
\par poignant because it was purely selfish. But moments such as these were      
\par rare. That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred          
\par in him, as they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed          
\par to increase with gratification. The more he knew, the more he               
\par desired to know. He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he           
\par fed them.                                                                   
\par   Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to           
\par society. Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each           
\par Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to           
\par the world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians        
\par of the day to charm his guests with the wonder's of their art. His          
\par little dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted         
\par him, were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those      
\par invited, as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the          
\par table, with its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and        
\par embroidered cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver. Indeed,           
\par there were many, especially among the very young men, who saw, or           
\par fancied that they saw, in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type        
\par of which they had often dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that         
\par was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all        
\par the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the            
\par world. To them he seemed to be of the company of those whom Dante           
\par describes as having sought to "make themselves perfect by the               
\par worship of beauty." Like Gautier, he was one for whom "the visible          
\par world existed."                                                             
\par   And certainly, to him Life itself was the first, the greatest, of         
\par the arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a                  
\par preparation. Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for         
\par a moment universal, and Dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt      
\par to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their           
\par fascination for him. His mode of dressing, and the particular styles        
\par that from time to time he affected, had their marked influence on           
\par the young exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall Club                
\par windows, who copied him in everything that he did, and tried to             
\par reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful, though to him only          
\par half-serious fopperies.                                                     
\par   For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was           
\par almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found,          
\par indeed, a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become        
\par to the London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author      
\par of the "Satyricon" once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired        
\par to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum, to be consulted      
\par on the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the             
\par conduct of a cane. He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that      
\par would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and          
\par find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.           
\par   The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been          
\par decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and        
\par sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are            
\par conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of                
\par existence. But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of           
\par the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained            
\par savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them        
\par into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making        
\par them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for           
\par beauty was to be the dominant characteristic. As he looked back upon        
\par man moving through History, he was haunted by a feeling of loss. So         
\par much had been surrendered! and to such little purpose! There had            
\par been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and             
\par self-denial, whose origin was fear, and whose result was a degradation      
\par infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which,          
\par in their ignorance, they had sought to escape, Nature, in her               
\par wonderful irony, driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild            
\par animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field      
\par as his companions.                                                          
\par    Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonisim      
\par that was to re-create life, and to save it from that harsh, uncomely        
\par Puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival. It was      
\par to have its service of the intellect, certainly; yet, it was never          
\par to accept any theory, or system that would involve the sacrifice of         
\par any mode of passionate experience. Its aim, indeed, was to be               
\par experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter        
\par as they might be. Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the      
\par vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing. But it           
\par was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life          
\par that is itself but a moment.                                                
\par   There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn,           
\par either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost              
\par enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen          
\par joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more             
\par terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that        
\par lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring          
\par vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those      
\par whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie. Gradually        
\par white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to                
\par tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the             
\par corners of the room, and crouch there. Outside, there is the                
\par stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to      
\par their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the            
\par hills, and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to         
\par wake the steepers, and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple      
\par cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees         
\par the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the      
\par dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan mirrors get         
\par back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we had left         
\par them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been               
\par studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the          
\par letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.      
\par Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night         
\par comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where      
\par we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the           
\par necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of      
\par stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids          
\par might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in      
\par the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have           
\par fresh shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a          
\par world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive,          
\par at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the              
\par remembrance even of joy having its bitterness, and the memories of          
\par pleasure their pain.                                                        
\par   It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian         
\par Gray to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of like;           
\par and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and              
\par delightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so              
\par essential to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought         
\par that he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself to           
\par their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their         
\par colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with            
\par that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real              
\par ardour of temperament, and that indeed, according to certain modern         
\par psychologists, is often a condition of it.                                  
\par   It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman           
\par Catholic communion; and certainly the Roman ritual had always a             
\par great attraction for him. The daily sacrifice, more awful really            
\par than all the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by        
\par its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive      
\par simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy      
\par that it sought to symbolize. He loved to kneel down on the cold marble      
\par pavement, and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly      
\par and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or            
\par raising aloft the jewelled lantern-shaped monstrance with that              
\par pallid wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the "panis      
\par caelestis," the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the           
\par Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice, and smiting his      
\par breast for his sins. The fuming censers, that the grave boys, in their      
\par lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers, had          
\par their subtle fascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look         
\par with wonder at the black confessionals, and long to sit in the dim          
\par shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through        
\par the worn grating the true story of their lives.                             
\par   But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual            
\par development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of              
\par mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable        
\par for the sojourn of a night or for a few hours of a night in which           
\par there are no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism, with its          
\par marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle      
\par antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a            
\par season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of      
\par the Darwinismus movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in        
\par tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the         
\par brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception        
\par of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical                
\par conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased. Yet, as has been         
\par said of him before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any            
\par importance compared with life itself. He felt keenly conscious of           
\par how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from              
\par action and experiment. He knew that the senses, no less than the soul,      
\par have their spiritual mysteries to reveal.                                   
\par   And so he would now study perfumes, and the secrets of their              
\par manufacture, distilling heavily-scented oils, and burning odorous gums      
\par from the East. He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had           
\par not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to                
\par discover their true relations, wondering what there was in                  
\par frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred          
\par one's passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead                 
\par romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in Champak that          
\par stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real              
\par psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of           
\par sweet-smelling roots, and scented pollen-laden flowers, of aromatic         
\par balms, and of dark and fragrant woods, of spikenard that sickens, of        
\par hovenia that makes men mad, and of aloes that are said to be able to        
\par expel melancholy from the soul.                                             
\par   At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a            
\par long latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of          
\par olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad          
\par gypsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave yellow-shawled        
\par Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while         
\par grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums, and, crouching        
\par upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of         
\par reed or brass, and charmed, or feigned to charm, great hooded snakes        
\par and horrible horned adders. The harsh intervals and shrill discords of      
\par barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert's grace, and              
\par Chopin's beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven           
\par himself, fell unheeded on his ear. He collected together from all           
\par parts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found,           
\par either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes          
\par that have survived contact with Western civilizations, and loved to         
\par touch and try them. He had the mysterious juruparis of the Rio Negro        
\par Indians, that women are not allowed to look at, and that even youths        
\par may not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging,         
\par and the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries of         
\par birds, and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in         
\par Chile, and the sonorous green jaspers that are found near Cuzco and         
\par give forth a note of singular sweetness. He had painted gourds              
\par filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken; the long            
\par clarin of the Mexicans, into which the performer does not blow, but         
\par through which he inhales the air; the harsh ture of the Amazon tribes,      
\par that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees,        
\par and can be heard, it is said, at a distance of three leagues; the           
\par teponaztli, that has two vibrating tongues of wood, has her                 
\par monsters, things of bestial shape and with an elastic gum obtained          
\par from the milky juice of plants; the Yotl-bells of the Aztecs, that are      
\par hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered          
\par with the skins of great serpents, like the one that Bernal Diaz saw         
\par when he went with Cortes into the Mexican temple, and of whose doleful      
\par sound he has left us so vivid a description. The fantastic character        
\par of these instruments fascinated him, and he felt a curious delight          
\par in the thought that Art, like Nature, has her monsters, things of           
\par bestial shape and with hideous voices. Yet, after some time, he             
\par wearied of them, and would sit in his box at the Opera, either alone        
\par or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt pleasure to "Tannhauser," and         
\par seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of           
\par the tragedy of his own soul.                                                
\par   On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a         
\par costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered      
\par with five hundred and sixty pearls. This taste enthralled him for           
\par years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him. He would often      
\par spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various        
\par stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that      
\par turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wire-like line of            
\par silver, the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow           
\par topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous four-rayed              
\par stars, flame-red cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and            
\par amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby, and sapphire. He             
\par loved the red gold of the sunstone, and the moonstone's pearly              
\par whiteness, and the broken rainbow of the milky opal. He procured            
\par from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of         
\par colour, and had a turquoise de la vieille roche that was the envy of        
\par all the connoisseurs.                                                       
\par   He discovered wonderful stories, also about jewels. In Alphonso's         
\par "Clericalis Disciplina" a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real           
\par jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of         
\par Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan, snakes "with          
\par collars of real emeralds growing on their backs." There was a gem in        
\par the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and "by the                  
\par exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet robe" the monster could          
\par be thrown into a magical sleep, and slain. According to the great           
\par alchemist, Pierre de Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible,        
\par and the agate of India made him eloquent. The cornelian appeased            
\par anger, and the hyacinth provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away         
\par the fumes of wine. The garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus           
\par deprived the moon of her colour. The selenite waxed and waned with the      
\par moon, and the meloceus, that discovers thieves, could be affected only      
\par by the blood of kids. Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone             
\par taken from the brain of a newly-killed toad, that was certain antidote      
\par against poison. The bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian      
\par deer, was a charm that could cure the plague. In the nests of               
\par Arabian birds was the aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept        
\par the wearer from his city with fire.                                         
\par   The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his         
\par hand, at the ceremony of his coronation. The gates of the palace of         
\par John the Priest were "made of sardius, with the horn of the horned          
\par snake inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within." Over the        
\par gable were "two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles," so            
\par that the gold might shine by day, and the carbuncles by night. In           
\par Lodge's strange romance "A Margarite of America" it was stated that in      
\par the chamber of the queen one could behold "all the chaste ladies of         
\par the world, inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrors of          
\par chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults." Marco            
\par Polo had seen the inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in      
\par the mouths of the dead. A sea monster had been enamoured of the             
\par pearl that the diver brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief,      
\par and mourned for seven moons over its loss. When the Huns lured the          
\par king into the great pit, he flung it away- Procopius tells the              
\par story- nor was it ever found again, though the Emperor Anastasius           
\par offered five hundred-weight of gold pieces for it. The King of Malabar      
\par had shown to a certain Venetian a rosary of three hundred and four          
\par pearls, one for every god that he worshipped.                               
\par   When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI., visited Louis         
\par XII. of France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to         
\par Brantome, and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great      
\par light. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four             
\par hundred and twenty-one diamonds. Richard II. had a coat, valued at          
\par thirty thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies. Hall            
\par described Henry VIII., on his way to the Tower previous to his              
\par coronation, as wearing "a jacket of raised gold, the placard                
\par embroidered with diamonds and other rich stones, and a great bauderike      
\par about his neck of large balasses." The favourites of James I. wore          
\par earrings of emeralds set in gold filigrane. Edward II. gave to Piers        
\par Gaveston a suit of red-gold armour studded with jacinths, a collar          
\par of gold roses set with turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap parseme            
\par with pearls. Henry II. wore jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and      
\par had a hawk-glove sewn with twelve rubies and fifty-two great                
\par orients. The ducal hat of Charles the Rash, the last Duke of                
\par Burgundy of his race, was hung with pear-shaped pearls, and studded         
\par with sapphires.                                                             
\par   How exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and            
\par decoration! Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.           
\par   Then he turned his attention to embroideries, and to the                  
\par tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of      
\par the Northern nations of Europe. As he investigated the subject- and he      
\par always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed         
\par for the moment in whatever he took up- he was almost saddened by the        
\par reflection of the ruin that Time brought on beautiful and wonderful         
\par things. He, at any rate, had escaped that. Summer followed summer, and      
\par the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of              
\par horror repeated the story of their shame, but he was unchanged. No          
\par winter marred his face or stained his flower-like bloom. Flow               
\par different it was with material things! Where had they passed to? Where      
\par was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which the gods had fought            
\par against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls for the             
\par pleasure of Athena? Where, the huge velarium that Nero had stretched        
\par across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on which was        
\par represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by           
\par white gilt-reined steeds? He longed to see the curious table-napkins        
\par wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were displayed all the          
\par dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; the mortuary          
\par cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the            
\par fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of               
\par Pontus, and were figured with "lions, panthers, bears, dogs,                
\par forests, rocks, hunters- all, in fact, that a painter can copy from         
\par nature;"- and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the            
\par sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning            
\par "Madame, je suis tout joyeux," the musical accompaniment of the             
\par words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, of square shape          
\par in those days, formed with four pearls. He read of the room that was        
\par prepared at the palace at Rheims for the use of Queen Joan of               
\par Burgundy, and was decorated with "thirteen hundred and twenty-one           
\par parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the king's arms, and five      
\par hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly               
\par ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked in gold."           
\par Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black velvet        
\par powdered with crescents and suns. Its curtains were of damask, with         
\par leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground, and      
\par fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in a        
\par room hung with rows of the queen's devices in cut black velvet upon         
\par cloth of silver. Louis XIV. had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen         
\par feet high in his apartment. The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland,      
\par was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with              
\par verses from the Koran. Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully        
\par chased, and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions. It        
\par had been taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard        
\par of Mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.             
\par   And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite      
\par specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work,               
\par getting the dainty Delhi muslines, finely wrought with gold with            
\par gold thread palmates, and stitched over with iridescent beetles'            
\par wings; the Dacca gauzes, that from their transparency are known in the      
\par East as "wovenair," and "running water," and "evening dew"; strange         
\par figured cloths from Java; elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books          
\par bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks, and wrought with fleurs de        
\par lys, birds and images: veils of lacis worked in Hungary point;              
\par Sicilian brocades, and stiff Spanish velvets; Georgian work with its        
\par gilt coins, and Japanese Foukousas with their green-toned golds and         
\par their marvellously plumaged birds.                                          
\par   He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as          
\par indeed he had for everything connected with the service of the Church.      
\par In the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house he        
\par had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really         
\par the raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels         
\par and fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is          
\par worn by the suffering that she seeks for, and wounded by                    
\par self-inflicted pain. He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk           
\par and gold-thread damask, figured with a repeating pattern of golden          
\par pomegranates set in six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on           
\par either side was the pineapple device wrought in seed-pearls. The            
\par orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of      
\par the Virgin, and the coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured        
\par silks upon the hood. This was Italian work of the fifteenth century.        
\par Another cope was of green velvet, embroidered with Heart-shaped groups      
\par of acanthus-leaves, from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the      
\par details of which were picked out with silver thread and coloured            
\par crystals. The morse bore a seraph's head in gold-thread raised work.        
\par The orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were          
\par starred with medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St.      
\par Sebastian, He has chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue         
\par silk and gold brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold,            
\par figured with representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ,      
\par and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics        
\par of white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and              
\par dolphins and fleurs de lys; altar frontals of crimson velvet and            
\par blue linen; and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria. In the          
\par mystic offices to which such things were put, there was something that      
\par quickened his imagination.                                                  
\par   For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his              
\par lovely house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which      
\par he could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at          
\par times to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of the lonely      
\par locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung          
\par with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features            
\par showed him the real degradation of his life, and in front of it had         
\par draped the purple-and-gold pall as a curtain. For weeks he would not        
\par go there, would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his          
\par light heart, his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in         
\par mere existence. Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the        
\par house, go down to dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay           
\par there, day after day, until he was driven away. On his return he would      
\par sit in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but         
\par filled, at other times, with that pride of individualism that is            
\par half the fascination of sin, and smiling, with secret pleasure, at the      
\par misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his      
\par own.                                                                        
\par   After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and      
\par gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry,          
\par as well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they           
\par had more than once spent the winter. He hated to be separated from the      
\par picture that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that          
\par during his absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of      
\par the elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.           
\par   He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing. It was          
\par true that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and          
\par ugliness of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could        
\par they learn from that? He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt          
\par him. He had not painted it. What was it to him how vile and full of         
\par shame it looked? Even if he told them, would they believe it?               
\par   Yet he was afraid. Sometimes when he was down at his great house          
\par in Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his           
\par own rank who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by        
\par the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendor of his mode of life, he             
\par would suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that           
\par the door had not been tampered with, and that the picture was still         
\par there. What if it should be stolen? The mere thought made him cold          
\par with horror. Surely the world would know his secret then. Perhaps           
\par the world already suspected it.                                             
\par   For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted        
\par him. He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his         
\par birth and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and        
\par it was said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into      
\par the smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another          
\par gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out. Curious stories           
\par became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year. It      
\par was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in         
\par a low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted        
\par with thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade. His         
\par extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear      
\par again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or            
\par pass him with a sneer, or look at him with cold, searching eyes, as         
\par though they were determined to discover his secret.                         
\par   Of such insolences and attempted slights, he, of course, took no          
\par notice, and in the opinion of most people his frank debonnair               
\par manner, his charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that           
\par wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a        
\par sufficient answer to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were      
\par circulated about him. It was remarked, however, that some of those who      
\par had been most intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him.        
\par Women who had wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all            
\par social censure and set convention at defiance, were seen to grow            
\par pallid with shame or horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.                
\par   Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many, his      
\par strange and dangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain element of      
\par security. Society, civilized society at least, is never very ready          
\par to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and         
\par fascinating. It feels instinctively that manners are of more                
\par importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest                    
\par respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good          
\par chef. And, after all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that         
\par the man who has given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is                    
\par irreproachable in his private life. Even the cardinal virtues cannot        
\par atone for half-cold entrees, as Lord Henry remarked once, in a              
\par discussion on the subject; and there is possibly a good deal to be          
\par said for his view. For the canons of good society are, or should be,        
\par the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely essential to it.          
\par It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as its unreality,         
\par and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the      
\par wit and beauty that makes such plays delightful to us. Is                   
\par insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a              
\par method by which we can multiply our personalities.                          
\par   Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion. He used to wonder at        
\par the shallow psychology of those who conceive the Ego in man as a thing      
\par simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man was a          
\par being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform          
\par creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and            
\par passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous                
\par maladies of the dead. He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold             
\par picture-gallery of his country house and look at the various portraits      
\par of those whose blood flowed in his veins. Here was Philip Herbert,          
\par described by Francis Osborne, in his "Memoires on the Reigns of             
\par Queen Elizabeth and King James," as one who was "caressed by the Court      
\par for his handsome face, which kept him not long company." Was it             
\par young Herbert's life that he sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous      
\par germ crept from body to body till it had reached his own? Was it            
\par some dim sense of that ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and      
\par almost without cause, give utterance, in Basil Hallward's studio, to        
\par the mad prayer that had so changed his life? Here, in gold-embroidered      
\par red doublet, jewelled surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wrist-bands,         
\par stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with his silver-and-black armour piled at        
\par his feet. What had this man's legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna        
\par of Naples bequeathed him some inheritance of sin and shame? Were his        
\par own actions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to            
\par realize? Here, from the fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux,      
\par in her gauze hood, pearl stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower      
\par was in her right hand, and her left clasped an enamelled collar of          
\par white and damask roses. On a table by her side lay a mandolin and an        
\par apple. There were large green rosettes upon her little pointed              
\par shoes. He knew her life, and the strange stories that were told             
\par about her lovers. Had he something of her temperament in him? These         
\par oval heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him. What of George      
\par Willoughby, with his powdered hair and fantastic patches? How evil          
\par he looked! The face was saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips         
\par seemed to be twisted with disdain. Delicate lace ruffles fell over the      
\par lean yellow hands that were so overladen with rings. He had been a          
\par macaroni of the eighteenth century, and the friend, in his youth, of        
\par Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord Beckenham, the companion of           
\par the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the      
\par secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How proud and handsome he            
\par was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose! What passions had he        
\par bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as infamous. He had led           
\par the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the Garter glittered upon his      
\par breast. Beside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pallid,                 
\par thin-lipped woman in black. Her blood, also, stirred within him. How        
\par curious it all seemed! And his mother with her Lady Hamilton face, and      
\par her moist wine-dashed lips- he knew what he had got from her. He had        
\par got from her his beauty, and his passion for the beauty of others. She      
\par laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress. There were vine leaves in      
\par her hair. The purple spilled from the cup she was holding. The              
\par carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes were still            
\par wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour. They seemed to           
\par follow him wherever he went.                                                
\par   Yet one had ancestors in literature, as well as in one's own race,        
\par nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly         
\par with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious. There         
\par were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history        
\par was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act        
\par and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it      
\par had been in his brain and in his passions. He felt that he had known        
\par them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the         
\par stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of           
\par subtlety. It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had      
\par been his own.                                                               
\par   The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life           
\par had himself known this curious fancy. In the seventh chapter he             
\par tells how, crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he         
\par had sat, as Tiberius, in a garden at Capri reading the shameful             
\par books of Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him           
\par and the flute-player mocked the swagger of the censer, and, as              
\par Caligula, had caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their              
\par stables, and supped in an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted              
\par horse; and, as Domitian, had wandered through a corridor lined with         
\par marble mirrors, looking round with haggard eyes for the reflection          
\par of the digger that was to end his days, and sick with that ennui, that      
\par terrible taedium vitae, that comes on those to whom life denies             
\par nothing: and had peered through a clear emerald at the red shambles of      
\par the Circus, and then, in a litter of pearl and purple drawn by              
\par silver-shod mules, been carried through the Street of Pomegranates          
\par to a House of Gold, and heard men cry on Nero Caesar as he passed           
\par by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with colours, and plied        
\par the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon from Carthage, and        
\par given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.                                    
\par   Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter,           
\par and the two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some            
\par curious tapestries or cunningly-wrought enamels, were pictured the          
\par awful and beautiful forms of those whom Vice and Blood and Weariness        
\par had made monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his             
\par wife, and painted her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover             
\par might suck death from the dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the          
\par Venetian, known as Paul the Second, who sought in his vanity to assume      
\par the title of Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand      
\par florins, was bought at the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria              
\par Visconti, who used hounds to chase living men, and whose murdered body      
\par was covered with roses by a harlot who had loved him; the Borgia on         
\par his white horse, with Fratricide riding beside him, and his mantle          
\par stained with the blood of Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal        
\par Archbishop of Florence, child and minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty        
\par was equalled only by his debauchery, and who received Leonora of            
\par Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and      
\par centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might serve at the feast as              
\par Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy could be cured only by         
\par the spectacle of death, and who had a passion for red blood, as             
\par other men have for red wine- the son of the Fiend, as was reported,         
\par and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling with him           
\par for his own soul: Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the name of        
\par Innocent, and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads was           
\par infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta,      
\par and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the enemy        
\par of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave poison      
\par to Ginevra d'Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a shameful          
\par passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles VI., who        
\par had so wildly adored his brother's wife that a leper had warned him of      
\par the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his brain had            
\par sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards          
\par painted with the images of Love and Death and Madness; and, in his          
\par trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthus-like curls, Grifonetto         
\par Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his           
\par page, and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the            
\par yellow piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but      
\par weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.                        
\par   There was a horrible fascination in them all. He saw them at              
\par night, and they troubled his imagination in the day. The Renaissance        
\par knew of strange manners of poisoning- poisoning by a helmet and a           
\par lighted torch, by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded      
\par pomander and by an amber chain. Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a          
\par book. There were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode            
\par through which he could realize his conception of the beautiful.             
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                              CHAPTER XII                                    
\par -                                                                           
\par   It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own thirty-eighth         
\par birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.                                
\par   He was walking home about eleven o'clock from Lord Henry's, where he      
\par had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was            
\par cold and foggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley          
\par Street a man passed him in the mist, walking very fast, and with the        
\par collar of his grey ulster turned up. He had a bag in his hand.              
\par Dorian recognized him. It was Basil Hallward. A strange sense of fear,      
\par for which he could not account, came over him. He made no sign of           
\par recognition, and went on quickly, in the direction of his own house.        
\par   But Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping on the         
\par pavement and then hurrying after him. In a few moments his hand was on      
\par his arm.                                                                    
\par   "Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting         
\par for you in your library ever since nine o'clock. Finally I took pity        
\par on your tired servant, and told him to go to bed, as he let me out.         
\par I am off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted          
\par to see you, before I left. I thought it was you, or rather your fur         
\par coat, as you passed me. But I wasn't quite sure. Didn't you                 
\par recognize me?"                                                              
\par   "In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can't even recognize Grosvenor        
\par Square, I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don't feel        
\par at all certain about it. I am sorry you are going away, as I have           
\par not seen you for ages. But I suppose you will be back soon?"                
\par   "No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to          
\par take a studio in Paris, and shut myself up till I have finished a           
\par great picture I have in my head. However, it wasn't about myself I          
\par wanted to talk. Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a moment.      
\par I have something to say to you."                                            
\par   "I shall be charmed. But won't you miss your train?" said Dorian          
\par Gray, languidly, as he passed up the steps and opened the door with         
\par his latch-key.                                                              
\par   The lamp-light struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at      
\par his watch.                                                                  
\par   "I have heaps of time," he answered. "The train doesn't go till           
\par twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In fact, I was on my way        
\par to the club to look for you, when I met you. You see, I sha'n't have        
\par any delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All I have      
\par with me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty          
\par minutes."                                                                   
\par   Dorian looked at him and smiled. "What a way for a fashionable            
\par painter to travel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the           
\par fog will get into the house. And mind you don't talk about anything         
\par serious. Nothing is serious nowadays. At least nothing should be."          
\par   Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the      
\par library. There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open             
\par hearth. The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case            
\par stood, with some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers,        
\par on a little marqueterie table.                                              
\par   "You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He gave me           
\par everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes. He is      
\par a most hospitable creature. I like him much better than the                 
\par Frenchman you used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by the        
\par bye?"                                                                       
\par   Dorian shrugged his shoulders. "I believe he married Lady Radley's        
\par maid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker.            
\par Anglomanie is very fashionable over there now, I hear. It seems             
\par silly of the French, doesn't it? But- do you know?- he was not at           
\par all a bad servant. I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain         
\par about. One often imagines things that are quite absurd. He was              
\par really very devoted to me, and seemed quite sorry when he went away.        
\par Have another brandy-and-soda? Or would you like hock-and-seltzer? I         
\par always take hock-and-seltzer myself. There is sure to be some in the        
\par next room."                                                                 
\par   "Thanks, I won't have anything more," said the painter, taking his        
\par cap and coat off, and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in        
\par the corner. "And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you                
\par seriously. Don't frown like that. You make it so much more difficult        
\par for me."                                                                    
\par   "What is it all about?" cried Dorian, in his petulant way,                
\par flinging himself down on the sofa. "I hope it is not about myself. I        
\par am tired of myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else."            
\par   "It is about yourself," answered Hallward, in his grave, deep voice,      
\par "and I must say it to you. I shall only keep you half an hour."             
\par   Dorian sighed, and lit a cigarette. "Half an hour!" he murmured.          
\par   "It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your        
\par own sake that I am speaking. I think it right that you should know          
\par that the most dreadful things are being said against you in London."        
\par    "I don't wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about         
\par other people, but scandals about myself don't interest me. They have        
\par not got the charm of novelty."                                              
\par   "They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in         
\par his good name. You don't want people to talk of you as something            
\par vile and degraded. Of course you have your position, and your               
\par wealth, and all that kind of thing. But position and wealth are not         
\par everything. Mind you, I don't believe these rumours at all. At              
\par least, I can't believe them when I see you. Sin is a thing that writes      
\par itself across a man's face. It cannot be concealed. People talk             
\par sometimes of secret vices. There are no such things. If a wretched man      
\par has a vice, it shows itself in the lines of his mouth, the droop of         
\par his eyelids, the moulding of his hands even. Somebody- I won't mention      
\par his name, but you know him- came to me last year to have his                
\par portrait done. I had never seen him before, and had never heard             
\par anything about him at the time, though I have heard a good deal since.      
\par He offered an extravagant price. I refused him. There was something in      
\par the shape of his fingers that I hated. I know now that I was quite          
\par right in what I fancied about him. His life is dreadful. But you,           
\par Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent face, and your marvellous          
\par untroubled youth- I can't believe anything against you. And yet I           
\par see you very seldom, and you never come down to the studio now, and         
\par when I am away from you, and I hear all these hideous things that           
\par people are whispering about you, I don't know what to say. Why is           
\par it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves the room of a        
\par club when you enter it? Why is it that so many gentlemen in London          
\par will neither go to your house nor invite you to theirs? You used to be      
\par a friend of Lord Staveley. I met him at dinner last week. Your name         
\par happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the miniatures      
\par you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley. Staveley curled his          
\par lip, and said that you might have the most artistic tastes, but that        
\par you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to know, and      
\par whom no chaste woman would sit in the same room with. I reminded him        
\par that I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant. He told me.      
\par He told me right out before everybody. It was horrible! Why is your         
\par friendship so fatal to young men? There was that wretched boy in the        
\par Guards who committed suicide. You were his great friend. There was Sir      
\par Henry Ashton, who had to leave England, with a tarnished name. You and      
\par he were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton, and his dreadful          
\par end? What about Lord Kent's only son, and his career? I met his father      
\par yesterday in St. James's Street. He seemed broken with shame and            
\par sorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth? What sort of life has he        
\par got now? What gentleman would associate with him?"                          
\par   "Stop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know              
\par nothing," said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of              
\par infinite contempt in his voice. "You ask me why Berwick leaves a            
\par room when I enter it. It is because I know everything about his             
\par life, not because he knows anything about mine. With such blood as          
\par he has in his veins, how could his record be clean? You ask me about        
\par Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did I teach the one his vices, and the        
\par other his debauchery? If Kent's silly son takes his wife from the           
\par streets, what is that to me? If Adrian Singleton writes his friend's        
\par name across a bill, am I his keeper? I know how people chatter in           
\par England. The middle classes air their moral prejudices over their           
\par gross dinner-tables, and whisper about what they call the profligacies      
\par of their betters in order to try and pretend that they are in smart         
\par society, and on intimate terms with the people they slander. In this        
\par country it is enough for a man to have distinction and brains for           
\par every common tongue to wag against him. And what sort of lives do           
\par these people, who pose as being moral, lead themselves? My dear             
\par fellow, you forget that we are in the native land of the hypocrite."        
\par   "Dorian," cried Hallward, "that is not the question. England is           
\par bad enough I know, and English society is all wrong. That is the            
\par reason why I want you to be fine. You have not been fine. One has a         
\par right to judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends. Yours        
\par seem to lose all sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have          
\par filled them with a madness for pleasure. They have gone down into           
\par the depths. You led them there. Yes: you led them there, and yet you        
\par can smile, as you are smiling now. And there is worse behind. I,            
\par know you and Harry are inseparable. Surely for that reason, if for          
\par none other, you should not have made his sister's name a byword."           
\par   "Take care, Basil. You go too far."                                       
\par   "I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you met        
\par Lady Gwendolyn, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her. Is there      
\par a single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the         
\par Park? Why, even her children are not allowed to live with her. Then         
\par there are other stories- stories that you have been seen creeping at        
\par dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the               
\par foulest dens in London. Are they true? Can they be true? When I             
\par first heard them, I laughed. I hear them now, and they make me              
\par shudder. What about your country house, and the life that is led            
\par there? Dorian, you don't know what is said about you. I won't tell you      
\par that I don't want to preach to you. I remember Harry saying once            
\par that every man who turned himself into an amateur curate for the            
\par moment always begin by saying that, and then proceeded to break his         
\par word. I do want to preach to you. I want you to lead such a life as         
\par will make the world respect you. I want you to have a clean name and a      
\par fair record. I want you to get rid of the dreadful people you               
\par associate with. Don't shrug your shoulders like that. Don't be so           
\par indifferent. You have a wonderful influence. Let it be for good, not        
\par for evil. They say that you corrupt every one with whom you become          
\par intimate, and that it is quite sufficient for you to enter a house,         
\par for shame of some kind to follow after. I don't know whether it is          
\par or not. How should I know? But it is said of you. I am told things          
\par that it seems impossible to doubt. Lord Gloucester was one of my            
\par greatest friends at Oxford. He showed me a letter that his wife had         
\par written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone.            
\par Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever             
\par read. I told him that it was absurd- that I knew you thoroughly, and        
\par that you were incapable of anything of the kind. Know you? I wonder do      
\par I know you? Before I could answer that, I should have to see your           
\par soul."                                                                      
\par   "To see my soul!" muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa         
\par and turning almost white from fear.                                         
\par   "Yes," answered Hallward, gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his      
\par voice, "to see your soul. But only God can do that."                        
\par   A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man.         
\par "You shall see it yourself, to-night!" he cried, seizing a lamp from        
\par the table. "Come: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldn't you look          
\par at it? You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you               
\par choose. Nobody would believe you. If they did believe you, they             
\par would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you         
\par do, though you will prate about it so tediously. Come, I tell you. You      
\par have chattered enough about corruption. Now you shall look on it            
\par face to face."                                                              
\par   There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He               
\par stamped his foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He          
\par felt a terrible joy at the thought that some one else was to share his      
\par secret, and that the man who had painted the portrait that was the          
\par origin of all his shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life         
\par with the hideous memory of what he had done.                                
\par   "Yes," he continued, coming closer to him, and looking steadfastly        
\par into his stern eyes, "I shall show you my soul. You shall see the           
\par thing that you fancy only God can see."                                     
\par   Hallward started back. "This is blasphemy, Dorian!" he cried. "You        
\par must not say things like that. They are horrible, and they don't            
\par mean anything."                                                             
\par   "You think so?" he laughed again.                                         
\par   "I know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your        
\par good. You know I have always been a staunch friend to you."                 
\par   "Don't touch me. Finish what you have to say."                            
\par   A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter's face. He paused         
\par for a moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him. After all,          
\par what right had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray? If he had            
\par done a tithe of what was rumoured about him, how much he must have          
\par suffered! Then he straightened himself up, and walked over to the           
\par fireplace, and stood there, looking at the burning logs with their          
\par frost-like ashes and their throbbing cores of flame.                        
\par   "I am waiting, Basil," said the young man, in a hard, clear voice.        
\par   He turned round. "What I have to say is this," he cried. "You must        
\par give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against         
\par you. If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning          
\par to end, I shall believe you. Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Can't you        
\par see what I am going through? My God! don't tell me that you are bad,        
\par and corrupt, and shameful."                                                 
\par   Dorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips.             
\par "Come upstairs, Basil," he said, quietly. "I keep a diary of my life        
\par from day to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is                
\par written. I shall show it to you if you come with me."                       
\par   "I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have              
\par missed my train. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But don't        
\par ask me to read anything to-night. All I want is a plain answer to my        
\par question."                                                                  
\par   "That shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here.           
\par You will not have to read long."                                            
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                              CHAPTER XIII                                   
\par -                                                                           
\par   He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward            
\par following close behind. They walked softly, as men do instinctively at      
\par night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A         
\par rising wind made some of the windows rattle.                                
\par   When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the        
\par floor and taking out the key turned it in the lock. "You insist on          
\par knowing, Basil?" he asked, in a low voice.                                  
\par   "Yes."                                                                    
\par   "I am delighted," he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat           
\par harshly: "You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know          
\par everything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you          
\par think:" and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in. A          
\par cold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in      
\par a flame of murky orange. He shuddered. "Shut the door behind you,"          
\par he whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.                           
\par   Hallward glanced around him, with a puzzled expression. The room          
\par looked as if it had not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish            
\par tapestry, a curtained picture, an old Italian cassone, and an almost        
\par empty bookcase- that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a           
\par chair and a table. As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle         
\par that was standing on the mantelshelf he saw that the whole place was        
\par covered with dust, and that the carpet was in holes. A mouse ran            
\par scuffling behind the wainscoting. There was a damp odour of mildew.         
\par   "So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw          
\par that curtain back, and you will see mine."                                  
\par   The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. "You are mad, Dorian, or         
\par playing a part," muttered Hallward, frowning.                               
\par   "You won't? Then I must do it myself," said the young man; and he         
\par tore the curtain from its rod, and flung it on the ground.                  
\par   An exclamation of horror broke from the painter's lips as he saw          
\par in the dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him. There      
\par was something in its expression that filled him with disgust and            
\par loathing. Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray's own face that he was           
\par looking at! The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely               
\par spoiled that marvellous beauty. There was still some gold in the            
\par thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual mouth. The sodden eyes        
\par had kept something of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves        
\par had not yet completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from         
\par plastic throat. Yes, it was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He         
\par seemed to recognize his own brush-work, and the frame was his own           
\par design. The idea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid. He seized the           
\par lighted candle, and held it to the picture. In the left-hand corner         
\par was his own name, traced in long letters of bright vermilion.               
\par   It was some foul parody, some infamous, ignoble satire. He had never      
\par done that. Still, it was his own picture. He knew it, and he felt as        
\par if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice. His         
\par own picture! What did it mean? Why had it altered? He turned, and           
\par looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man. His mouth twitched,      
\par and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate. He passed his hand      
\par across his forehead. It was dank with clammy sweat.                         
\par   The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with      
\par that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are         
\par absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting. There was neither      
\par real sorrow in it nor real joy. There was simply the passion of the         
\par spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes. He had taken      
\par the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do        
\par so.                                                                         
\par   "What does this mean?" cried Hallward, at last. His own voice             
\par sounded shrill and curious in his ears.                                     
\par   "Years ago, when I was a boy," said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower      
\par in his hand, "you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my      
\par good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who             
\par explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me      
\par that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment, that,            
\par even now, I don't know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps      
\par you would call it a prayer...."                                             
\par   "I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is              
\par impossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The           
\par paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the      
\par thing is impossible."                                                       
\par   "Ah, what is impossible?" murmured the young man, going over to           
\par the window, and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained         
\par glass.                                                                      
\par   "You told me you had destroyed it."                                       
\par   "I was wrong. It has destroyed me."                                       
\par   "I don't believe it is my picture."                                       
\par   "Can't you see your ideal in it?" said Dorian, bitterly.                  
\par   "My ideal, as you call it...."                                            
\par   "As you called it."                                                       
\par   "There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such      
\par an ideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a satyr."         
\par   "Is it the face of my soul."                                              
\par   "Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a        
\par devil."                                                                     
\par   "Each of us has Heaven and Hell in him, Basil," cried Dorian, with a      
\par wild gesture of despair.                                                    
\par   Hallward turned again to the portrait, and gazed at it. "My God!          
\par if it is true," he exclaimed, "and this is what you have done with          
\par your life, why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you      
\par fancy you to be!" He held the light up again to the canvas, and             
\par examined it. The surface seemed to be quite undisturbed, and as he had      
\par left it. It was from within, apparently, that the foulness and              
\par horror had come. Through some strange quickening of inner life the          
\par leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away. The rotting of a        
\par corpse in a watery grave was not so fearful.                                
\par   His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor,         
\par and lay there sputtering. He placed his foot on it and put it out.          
\par Then he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by           
\par the table and buried his face in his hands.                                 
\par   "Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!" There was        
\par no answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window.           
\par "Pray, Dorian, pray," he murmured. "What is it that one was taught          
\par to say in one's boyhood? 'Lead us not into temptation. Forgive us           
\par our sins. Wash away our iniquities.' Let us say that together. The          
\par prayer of your pride has been answered. The prayer of your                  
\par repentance will be answered also. I worshipped you too much. I am           
\par punished for it. You worshipped yourself too. We are both punished."        
\par   Dorian Gray turned slowly around, and looked at him with tear-dimmed      
\par eyes. "It is too late, Basil," he faltered.                                 
\par   "It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we            
\par cannot remember a prayer. Isn't there a verse somewhere, 'Though            
\par your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow'?"           
\par   "Those words mean nothing to me now."                                     
\par   "Hush! don't say that. You have done enough evil in your life. My         
\par God! Don't you see that accursed thing leering at us?"                      
\par   Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable        
\par feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had        
\par been suggested to him by the image on the canvas, whispered into his        
\par ear by those grinning lips. The mad passions of a hunted animal             
\par stirred within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the            
\par table, more than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything. He         
\par glanced wildly around. Something glimmered on the top of the painted        
\par chest that faced him. His eye fell on it. He knew what it was. It           
\par was a knife that he had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece        
\par of cord, and had forgotten to take away with him. He moved slowly           
\par towards it, passing Hallward as he did so. As soon as he got behind         
\par him, he seized it, and turned round. Hallward stirred in his chair          
\par as if he was going to rise. He rushed at him, and dug the knife into        
\par the great vein that is behind the ear, crushing the man's head down on      
\par the table, and stabbing again and again.                                    
\par   There was a stifled groan, and the horrible sound of some one             
\par choking with blood. Three times the outstretched arms shot up               
\par convulsively, waving grotesque stiff-fingered hands in the air. He          
\par stabbed him twice more, but the man did not move. Something began to        
\par trickle on the floor. He waited for a moment, still pressing the            
\par head down. Then he threw the knife on the table, and listened.              
\par   He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare               
\par carpet. He opened the door and went out on the landing. The house           
\par was absolutely quiet. No one was about. For a few seconds he stood          
\par bending over the balustrade, and peering down into the black                
\par seething well of darkness. Then he took out the key and returned to         
\par the room, locking himself in as he did so.                                  
\par   The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table         
\par with bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. Had it           
\par not been for the red, jagged tear in the neck, and the clotted black        
\par pool that was slowly widening on the table, one would have said that        
\par the man was simply asleep.                                                  
\par   How quickly it had all been done! He felt strangely calm, and,            
\par walking over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the                
\par balcony. The wind had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a            
\par monstrous peacock's tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes. He           
\par looked down, and saw the policeman going his rounds and flashing the        
\par long beam of his lantern on the doors of the silent houses. The             
\par crimson spot of a prowling hansom gleamed at the corner, and then           
\par vanished. A woman in a fluttering shawl was creeping slowly by the          
\par railings, staggering as she went. Now and then she  stopped, and            
\par peered back. Once, she began to sing in a hoarse voice. The                 
\par policeman strolled over and said something to her. She stumbled             
\par away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the Square. The gas             
\par lamps flickered, and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their        
\par black iron branches to and fro. He shivered, and went back, closing         
\par the window behind him.                                                      
\par   Having reached the door, he turned the key, and opened it. He did         
\par not even glance at the murdered man. He felt that the secret of the         
\par whole thing was not to realize the situation. The friend who had            
\par painted the fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due, had        
\par gone out of his life. That was enough.                                      
\par   Then he remembered the lamp. It was a rather curious one of               
\par Moorish workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of          
\par burnished steel, and studded with coarse turquoises. Perhaps it             
\par might be missed by his servant, and questions would be asked. He            
\par hesitated for a moment, then he turned back and took it from the            
\par table. He could not help seeing the dead thing. How still it was!           
\par How horribly white the long hands looked! It was like a dreadful wax        
\par image.                                                                      
\par   Having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs.           
\par The woodwork creaked, and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He               
\par stopped several times, and waited. No: everything was still. It was         
\par merely. the sound of his own footsteps.                                     
\par   When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the               
\par corner. They must be hidden away somewhere. He unlocked a secret press      
\par that was in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own               
\par curious disguises, and put them into it. He could easily burn them          
\par afterwards. Then he pulled out his watch. It was twenty minutes to          
\par two.                                                                        
\par   He sat down and began to think. Every year- every month, almost- men      
\par were strangled in England for what he had done. There had been a            
\par madness of murder in the air. Some red star had come too close to           
\par the earth.... And yet what evidence was there against him? Basil            
\par Hallward had left the house at eleven. No one had seen him come in          
\par again. Most of the servants were at Selby Royal. His valet had gone to      
\par bed.... Paris? Yes. It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the         
\par midnight train, as he had intended. With his curious reserved               
\par habits, it would be months before any suspicions would be aroused.          
\par Months! Everything could be destroyed long before then.                     
\par   A sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat and hat, and          
\par went out into the hall. There he paused, hearing the slow, heavy tread      
\par of the policeman on the pavement outside, and seeing the flash of           
\par the bull's-eye reflected in the window. He waited, and held his             
\par breath.                                                                     
\par   After a few moments he drew back the latch, and slipped out,              
\par shutting the door very gently behind him. Then he began ringing, the        
\par bell. In about five minutes his valet appeared, half dressed, and           
\par looking very drowsy.                                                        
\par   "I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis," he said,                
\par stepping in; "but I had forgotten my latchkey. What time is it?"            
\par   "Ten minutes past two, sir," answered the man, looking at the             
\par clock and blinking.                                                         
\par   "Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine        
\par to-morrow. I have some work to do."                                         
\par   "All right, sir."                                                         
\par   "Did any one call this evening?"                                          
\par   "Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then he went          
\par away to catch his train."                                                   
\par   "Oh! I am sorry I didn't see him. Did he leave any message?"              
\par   "No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did         
\par not find you at the club."                                                  
\par   "That will do, Francis. Don't forget to call me at nine to-morrow."       
\par   "No, sir."                                                                
\par   The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.                        
\par   Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table, and passed into        
\par the library. For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room        
\par biting his lip, and thinking. Then he took down the Blue Book from one      
\par of the shelves, and began to turn over the leaves. "Alan Campbell,          
\par 152, Hertford Street, Mayfair." Yes; that was the man he wanted.            
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                              CHAPTER XIV                                    
\par -                                                                           
\par   At nine o'clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of        
\par chocolate on a tray, and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping           
\par quite peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath         
\par his cheek. He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or        
\par study.                                                                      
\par   The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and        
\par as he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as              
\par though he had been lost in some delightful dream. Yet he had not            
\par dreamed at all. His night had been untroubled by any images of              
\par pleasure or of pain. But youth smiles without any reason. It is one of      
\par its chiefest charms.                                                        
\par   He turned round, and, leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his            
\par chocolate. The mellow November sun came streaming into the room. The        
\par sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air. It was            
\par almost like a morning in May.                                               
\par   Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent             
\par bloodstained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there         
\par with terrible distinctness. He winced at the memory of all that he had      
\par suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for         
\par Basil Hallward, that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair,          
\par came back to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was           
\par still sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible that        
\par was! Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.            
\par   He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would           
\par sicken or grow mad. There were sins whose fascination was more in           
\par the memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that                 
\par gratified the pride more than the passions, and gave to the                 
\par intellect a quickened sense of joy, greater than a joy they brought,        
\par or could ever bring, to the senses. But this was not one of them. It        
\par was a thing to be driven out of the mind, to be drugged with                
\par poppies, to be strangled lest it might strangle one itself.                 
\par   When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead,        
\par and then got up hastily, and dressed himself with even more than his        
\par usual care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his            
\par necktie and scarf-pin, and changing his rings more than once. He spent      
\par a long time also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking        
\par to his valet about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting        
\par made for the servants at Selby, and going through his                       
\par correspondence. At some of the letters he smiled. Three of them             
\par bored him. One he read several times over, and then tore up with a          
\par slight look of annoyance in his face. "That awful thing, a woman's          
\par memory!" as Lord Henry had once said.                                       
\par   After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly      
\par with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to           
\par the table sat down and wrote two letters. One he put in his pocket,         
\par the other he handed to the valet.                                           
\par   "Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr.             
\par Campbell is out of town, get his address."                                  
\par   As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette, and began sketching          
\par upon a piece of paper, drawing first flowers, and bits of                   
\par architecture, and then human faces. Suddenly he remarked that every         
\par face that he drew seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil              
\par Hallward. He frowned, and getting up, went over to the bookcase and         
\par took out a volume at hazard. He was determined that he would not think      
\par about what had happened until it became absolutely necessary that he        
\par should do so.                                                               
\par   When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the               
\par title-page of the book. It was Gautier's "Emaux et Camees,"                 
\par Charpentier's Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching. The      
\par binding was of citron-green leather, with a design of gilt                  
\par trellis-work and dotted pomegranates. It had been given to him by           
\par Adrian Singleton. As he turned over the pages his eye fell on the poem      
\par about the hand of Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand "du supplice              
\par encore mal lavee," with its downy red hairs and its "doigts de faune."      
\par He glanced at his own white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in           
\par spite of himself, and passed on, till he came to those lovely               
\par stanzas upon Venice;                                                        
\par -                                                                           
\par               "Sur une gamme chromatique,

\par   How exquisite they were! As one read them, one seemed to be floating      
\par down the green waterways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black      
\par gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains. The mere lines              
\par looked to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that              
\par follow one as one pushes out to the Lido. The sudden flashes of colour      
\par reminded him of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that          
\par flutter round the tall honey-combed Campanile, or stalk, with such          
\par stately grace, through the dim, dust-stained arcades. Leaning back          
\par with half-closed eyes, he kept saying over and over to himself:             
\par -                                                                           
\par               "Devant une facade rose,                                      
\par                 Sur le marbre d'un escalier."                               
\par -                                                                           
\par   The whole of Venice was in those two lines. He remembered the autumn      
\par that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to      
\par mad, delightful follies. There was romance in every place. But Venice,      
\par like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true          
\par romantic, background was everything, or almost everything. Basil had        
\par been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret.            
\par Poor Basil! what a horrible way for a man to die!                           
\par   He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget. He          
\par read of the swallows that fly in and out of the little cafe at              
\par Smyrna where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the              
\par turbaned merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely        
\par to each other; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that      
\par weeps tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile, and longs to be         
\par back by the hot lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and           
\par rose-red ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles,      
\par with small beryl eyes, that crawl over the green steaming mud; he           
\par began to brood over those verses which, drawing music from                  
\par kiss-stained marble, tell of that curious statue that Gautier compares      
\par to a contralto voice, the "monstre charmant" that couches in the            
\par porphyry-room of the Louvre. But after a time the book fell from his        
\par hand. He grew nervous, and a horrible fit of terror came over him.          
\par What if Alan Campbell should be out of England? Days would elapse           
\par before he could come back. Perhaps he might refuse to come. What could      
\par he do then? Every moment was of vital importance.                           
\par   They had been great friends once, five years before- almost               
\par inseparable, indeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end.         
\par When they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled; Alan      
\par Campbell never did.                                                         
\par   He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real               
\par appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the          
\par beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian.           
\par His dominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he had      
\par spent a great deal of his time working in the Laboratory, and had           
\par taken a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year.               
\par Indeed, he was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a           
\par laboratory of his own, in which he used to shut himself up all day          
\par long, greatly to the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on      
\par his standing for parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was         
\par a person who made up prescriptions. He was an excellent musician,           
\par however, as well, and played both the violin and the piano better than      
\par most amateurs. In fact, it was music that had first brought him and         
\par Dorian Gray together- music and that indefinable attraction that            
\par Dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he wished, and indeed         
\par exercised often without being conscious of it. They had met at Lady         
\par Berkshire's the night that Rubinstein played there, and after that          
\par used to be always seen together at the Opera, and wherever good             
\par music was going on. For eighteen months their intimacy lasted.              
\par Campbell was always either at Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To        
\par him, as to many others, Dorian Dorian Gray was the type of                  
\par everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life. Whether or not a      
\par quarrel had taken place between them no one ever knew. But suddenly         
\par people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they met, and that            
\par Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at which Dorian      
\par Gray was present. He had changed, too- was strangely melancholy at          
\par times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and would never            
\par himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called upon, that he        
\par was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in which to             
\par practise. And this was certainly true. Every day he seemed to become        
\par more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice in          
\par some of the scientific reviews, in connection with certain curious          
\par experiments.                                                                
\par   This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he kept        
\par glancing at the clock. As the minutes went by he became horribly            
\par agitated. At last he got up, and began to pace up and down the room,        
\par looking like a beautiful caged thing. He took long stealthy strides.        
\par His hands were curiously cold.                                              
\par   The suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him to be crawling         
\par with feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards      
\par the jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice. He knew what was          
\par waiting for him there; saw it indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with         
\par dank hands his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very         
\par brain of sight, and driven the eyeballs back into their cave. It was        
\par useless. The brain had its own food on which it battened, and the           
\par imagination, made grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a           
\par living thing by pain, danced like some foul puppet on a stand, and          
\par grinned through moving masks. Then, suddenly, Time stopped for him.         
\par Yes: that blind, slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible         
\par thoughts, Time being dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a          
\par hideous future from its grave, and showed it to him. He stared at           
\par it. Its very horror made him stone.                                         
\par   At last the door opened, and his servant entered. He turned glazed        
\par eyes upon him.                                                              
\par   "Mr. Campbell, sir," said the man.                                        
\par   A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came         
\par back to his cheeks.                                                         
\par   "Ask him to come in at once, Francis." He felt that he was himself        
\par again. His mood of cowardice had passed away.                               
\par   The man bowed, and retired. In a few moments Alan Campbell walked         
\par in, looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified        
\par by his coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.                                   
\par   "Alan! this is kind of you. I thank you for coming."                      
\par   "I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray. But you            
\par said it was a matter of life and death." His voice was hard and             
\par cold. He spoke with slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt in      
\par the steady searching gaze that he turned on Dorian. He kept his             
\par hands in the pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have          
\par noticed the gesture with which he had been greeted.                         
\par   "Yes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one        
\par person. Sit down."                                                          
\par   Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to            
\par him. The two men's eyes met. In Dorian's there was infinite pity. He        
\par knew that what he was going to do was dreadful.                             
\par   After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said,            
\par very quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of         
\par him he had sent for, "Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house,      
\par a room to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated          
\par at a table. He has been dead ten hours now. Don't stir, and don't look      
\par at me like that. Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters      
\par that do not concern you. What you have to do is this-"                      
\par   "Stop, Gray. I don't want to know anything further. Whether what you      
\par have told me is true or not true, doesn't concern me. I entirely            
\par decline to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to          
\par yourself. They don't interest me any more."                                 
\par   "Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to              
\par interest you. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can't help            
\par myself. You are the one mark who is able to save me. I am forced to         
\par bring you into the matter. I have no option. Alan, you are scientific.      
\par You know about chemistry, and things of that kind. You have made            
\par experiments. What you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is        
\par upstairs- to destroy it so that not a vestige of it will be left.           
\par Nobody saw this person come into the house. Indeed, at the present          
\par moment he is supposed to be in Paris. He will not be missed for             
\par months. When he is missed, there must be no trace of him found here.        
\par You, Alan, you must change him, and everything that belongs to him,         
\par into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in the air."                     
\par   "You are mad, Dorian."                                                    
\par   "Ah! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian."                            
\par   "You are mad, I tell you- mad to imagine that I would raise a finger      
\par to help you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have             
\par nothing to do with this matter, whatever it is. Do you think I am           
\par going to peril my reputation for you? What is it to me what devil's         
\par work you are up to?"                                                        
\par   "It was suicide, Alan."                                                   
\par   "I am glad of that. But who drove him to it? You, I should fancy."        
\par   "Do you still refuse to do this for me?"                                  
\par   "Of course I refuse. I will have absolutely nothing to do with it. I      
\par don't care what shame comes on you. You deserve it all. I should not        
\par be sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How dare you ask         
\par me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror? I should      
\par have thought you knew more about people's characters. Your friend Lord      
\par Henry Wotton can't have taught you much about psychology, whatever          
\par else he has taught you. Nothing will induce me to stir a step to            
\par help you. You have come to the wrong man. Go to some of your                
\par friends. Don't come to me."                                                 
\par   "Alan, it was murder. I killed him. You don't know what he had            
\par made me suffer. Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making      
\par or marring of it than poor Harry has had. He may not have intended it,      
\par the result was he same."                                                    
\par   "Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I shall         
\par not inform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, without my             
\par stirring in the matter, you are certain to be arrested. Nobody ever         
\par commits a crime without doing something stupid. But I will have             
\par nothing to do with it."                                                     
\par   "You must have something to do with it. Wait, wait a moment;              
\par listen to me. Only listen, Alan. All I ask of you is to perform a           
\par certain scientific experiment. You go to hospitals and dead-houses,         
\par and the horrors that you do there don't affect you. If in some hideous      
\par dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a           
\par leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to            
\par flow through you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject.        
\par You would not turn a hair. You would not believe that you were doing        
\par anything wrong. On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were      
\par benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the        
\par world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that           
\par kind. What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before.      
\par Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you           
\par are accustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of           
\par evidence against me. If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to      
\par be discovered unless you help me."                                          
\par   "I have no desire to help you. You forget that. I am simply               
\par indifferent to the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me."              
\par   "Alan, I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before you      
\par came I almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself some        
\par day. No! don't think of that. Look at the matter purely from the            
\par scientific point of view. You don't inquire where the dead things on        
\par which you experiment come from. Don't inquire now. I have told you too      
\par much as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were friends once,           
\par Alan."                                                                      
\par   "Don't speak about those days, Dorian: they are dead."                    
\par   "The dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away. He is      
\par sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms. Alan!           
\par Alan! if you don't come to my assistance I am ruined. Why, they will        
\par hang me, Alan! Don't you understand? They will hang me for what I have      
\par done."                                                                      
\par   "There is no good in prolonging this scene. I absolutely refuse to        
\par do anything in the matter. It is insane of you to ask me."                  
\par   "You refuse?"                                                             
\par   "Yes."                                                                    
\par   "I entreat you, Alan."                                                    
\par   "It is useless."                                                          
\par   The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray's eyes. Then he               
\par stretched out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something          
\par on it. He read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it            
\par across the table. Having done this, he got up, and went over to the         
\par window.                                                                     
\par   Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper,           
\par and opened it. As he read it, his face became ghastly pale, and he          
\par fell back in his chair. A horrible sense of sickness came over him. He      
\par felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow.      
\par   After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round,      
\par and came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.          
\par   "I am so sorry for you, Alan," he murmured, "but you leave me no          
\par alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see           
\par the address. If you don't help me, I must send it. If you don't help        
\par me, I will send it. You know what the result will be. But you are           
\par going to help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I tried to        
\par spare you. You will do me the justice to admit that. You were stern,        
\par harsh, offensive. You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me-      
\par no living man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it is for me to dictate      
\par terms."                                                                     
\par   Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed               
\par through him.                                                                
\par   "Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they            
\par are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don't work yourself into this         
\par fever. The thing has to be done. Face it, and do it."                       
\par   A groan broke from Campbell's lips, and he shivered all over. The         
\par ticking of the clock on the mantel-piece seemed to him to be                
\par dividing time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too           
\par terrible to be borne. He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly           
\par tightened round his forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was          
\par threatened had already come upon him. The hand upon his shoulder            
\par weighed like a band of lead. It was intolerable. It seemed to crush         
\par him.                                                                        
\par   "Come, Alan, you must decide at once."                                    
\par   "I cannot do it," he said mechanically, as though words could             
\par alter things.                                                               
\par   "You must. You have no choice. Don't delay."                              
\par   He hesitated a moment. "Is there a fire in the room upstairs?"            
\par   "Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos."                                 
\par   "I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory."        
\par   "No, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out on a sheet of          
\par notepaper what you want, and my servant will take a cab and bring           
\par the things back to you."                                                    
\par   Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an             
\par envelope to his assistant. Dorian took the note up and read it              
\par carefully. Then he rang the bell, and gave it to his valet, with            
\par orders to return as soon as possible, and to bring the things with          
\par him.                                                                        
\par   As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and, having got        
\par up from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was shivering         
\par with a kind of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men          
\par spoke. A fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the          
\par clock was like the beat of a hammer.                                        
\par   As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and, looking at           
\par Dorian Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears. There was            
\par something in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to      
\par enrage him. "You are infamous, absolutely infamous!" he muttered.           
\par   "Hush, Alan: you have saved my life," said Dorian.                        
\par   "Your life? Good heavens! what a life that is. You have gone from         
\par corruption to corruption, and you have culminated in crime. In doing        
\par what I am going to do, what you force me to do, it is not of your life      
\par that I am thinking."                                                        
\par   "Ah, Alan," murmured Dorian, with a sigh, "I wish you had a               
\par thousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you." He turned          
\par away as he spoke, and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made        
\par no answer.                                                                  
\par   After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant         
\par entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long          
\par coil of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously-shaped iron        
\par clamps.                                                                     
\par   "Shall I leave the things here, sir?" he asked Campbell.                  
\par   "Yes," said Dorian. "And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another        
\par errand for you. What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies        
\par Selby with orchids?"                                                        
\par   "Harden, sir."                                                            
\par   "Yes- Harden. You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden            
\par personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered,        
\par and to have as few white ones as possible. In fact, I don't want any        
\par white ones. It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty      
\par place, otherwise I wouldn't bother you about it."                           
\par   "No trouble, sir. At what time shall I be back?"                          
\par   Dorian looked at Campbell. "How long will your experiment take,           
\par Alan?" he said, in a calm, indifferent voice. The presence of a             
\par third person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.          
\par   Campbell frowned, and bit his lip. "It will take about five               
\par hours," he answered.                                                        
\par   "It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven,        
\par Francis. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can            
\par have the evening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I shall           
\par not want you."                                                              
\par   "Thank you, sir," said the man, leaving the room.                         
\par   "Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this chest        
\par is! I'll take it for you. You bring the other things." He spoke             
\par rapidly, and in an authoritative manner. Campbell felt dominated by         
\par him. They left the room together.                                           
\par   When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and            
\par turned it in the lock. Then he stopped, and a troubled look came            
\par into his eyes. He shuddered. "I don't think I can go in, Alan," he          
\par murmured.                                                                   
\par   "It is nothing to me. I don't require you," said Campbell, coldly.        
\par   Dorian half opened the door. As he did so, he saw the face of his         
\par portrait leering in the sunlight. On the floor in front of it the torn      
\par curtain was lying. He remembered that the night before he had               
\par forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas,        
\par and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.            
\par   What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on      
\par one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood? How horrible      
\par it was!- more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the           
\par silent thing he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose        
\par grotesque misshapen shadow, on the spotted carpet showed him that it        
\par had not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.                    
\par   He heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with         
\par half-closed eyes and averted head walked quickly in, determined that        
\par he would not look even once upon the dead man. Then, stooping down,         
\par and taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he flung it right over           
\par the picture.                                                                
\par   There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed        
\par themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him. He heard           
\par Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other          
\par things that he had required for his dreadful work. He began to              
\par wonder if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they         
\par had thought of each other.                                                  
\par   "Leave me now," said a stern voice behind him.                            
\par   He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been      
\par thrust back into the chair, and that Campbell was gazing into a             
\par glistening yellow face. As he was going downstairs he heard the key         
\par being turned in the lock.                                                   
\par   It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library. He      
\par was pale, but absolutely calm. "I have done what you asked me to            
\par do," he muttered. "And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other           
\par again."                                                                     
\par   "You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that," said           
\par Dorian, simply.                                                             
\par   As soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs. There was a horrible      
\par smell of nitric acid in the room. But the thing that had been               
\par sitting at the table was gone.                                              
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                               CHAPTER XV                                    
\par -                                                                           
\par   That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed, and wearing a         
\par large button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into            
\par Lady Narborough's drawing-room by bowing servants. His forehead was         
\par throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his         
\par manner as he bent over his hostess's hand was as easy and graceful          
\par as ever. Perhaps one never seems so much at one's ease as when one has      
\par to play a part. Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night          
\par could have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible        
\par as any tragedy of our age. Those finely-shaped fingers could never          
\par have clutched a knife of sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on      
\par God and goodness. He himself could not help wondering at the calm of        
\par his demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a      
\par double life.                                                                
\par   It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough,        
\par who was a very clever woman, with what Lord Henry used to describe          
\par as the remains of really remarkable ugliness. She had proved an             
\par excellent wife to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having           
\par buried her husband properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had            
\par herself designed, and married off her daughters to some rich, rather        
\par elderly men, she devoted herself now to the pleasures of French             
\par fiction, French cookery, and French esprit when she could get it.           
\par   Dorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him        
\par that she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life. "I           
\par know, my dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you," she            
\par used to say, "and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake.      
\par It is most fortunate that you were not thought of at the time. As it        
\par was, our bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in      
\par trying to raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with           
\par anybody. However, that was all Narborough's fault. He was dreadfully        
\par short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who          
\par never sees anything."                                                       
\par   Her guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as she         
\par explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married           
\par daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make         
\par matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her. "I think          
\par it is most unkind of her, my dear," she whispered. "Of course I go and      
\par stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old      
\par woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really          
\par wake them up. You don't know what an existence they lead down there.        
\par It is pure unadulterated country life. They get up early, because they      
\par have so much to do, and go to bed early because they have so little to      
\par think about. There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since        
\par the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep          
\par after dinner. You sha'n't sit next either of them. You shall sit by         
\par me, and amuse me."                                                          
\par   Dorian murmured a graceful compliment, and looked round the room.         
\par Yes: it was certainly a tedious party. Two of the people he had             
\par never seen before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one        
\par of those middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have        
\par no enemies, but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Roxton,      
\par an overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was            
\par always trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly             
\par plain that to her great disappointment no one would ever believe            
\par anything against her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a                
\par delightful lisp, and Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his             
\par hostess's daughter, a dowdy dull girl, with one of those                    
\par characteristic British faces, that, once seen are never remembered;         
\par and her husband, a red-cheeked, white-whiskered creature who, like          
\par so many of his class, was under the impression that inordinate              
\par joviality can atone for an entire lack of ideas.                            
\par   He was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at         
\par the great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the            
\par mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: "How horrid of Henry Wotton to be      
\par so late! I sent round to him this morning on chance, and he promised        
\par faithfully not to disappoint me."                                           
\par   It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the          
\par door opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to            
\par some insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored.                            
\par   But at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away      
\par untasted. Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she called "an         
\par insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the menu specially for you,"           
\par and now and then Lord Henry looked across at him, wondering at his          
\par silence and abstracted manner. From time to time the butler filled his      
\par glass with champagne. He drank eagerly, and his thirst seemed to            
\par increase.                                                                   
\par   "Dorian," said Lord Henry, at last, as the chaudfroid was being           
\par handed round, "what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite out      
\par of sorts."                                                                  
\par   "I believe he is in love," cried Lady Narborough, "and that he is         
\par afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He is quite right. I        
\par certainly should."                                                          
\par   "Dear Lady Narborough," murmured Dorian, smiling, "I have not been        
\par in love for a whole week- not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left         
\par town."                                                                      
\par   "How you men can fall in love with that woman!" exclaimed the old         
\par lady. "I really cannot understand it."                                      
\par   "It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl,      
\par Lady Narborough," said Lord Henry. "She is the one link between us and      
\par your short frocks."                                                         
\par   "She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I          
\par remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how                  
\par dicolletee she was then."                                                   
\par   "She is still dicolletee," he answered, taking an olive in his            
\par long fingers; "and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like          
\par an edition de luxe of a bad French novel. She is really wonderful, and      
\par full of surprises. Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary.      
\par When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief."        
\par   "How can you, Harry!" cried Dorian.                                       
\par   "It is a most romantic explanation," laughed the hostess. "But her        
\par third husband, Lord Henry! You don't mean to say Ferrol is the              
\par fourth?"                                                                    
\par   "Certainly, Lady Narborough."                                             
\par   "I don't believe a word of it."                                           
\par   "Well, ask Mr. Gray. He is one of her most intimate friends."             
\par   "Is it true, Mr. Gray?"                                                   
\par   "She assures me so, Lady Narborough," said Dorian. "I asked her           
\par whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and      
\par hung at her girdle. She told me she didn't, because none of them had        
\par had any hearts at all."                                                     
\par   "Four husbands! Upon my word that is trop de zele."                       
\par   "Trop d' audace, I tell her," said Dorian.                                
\par   "Oh! she is audacious enough for anything, my dear. And what is           
\par Ferrol like? I don't know him."                                             
\par   "The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal              
\par classes," said Lord Henry, sipping his wine.                                
\par   Lady Narborough hit him with her fan. "Lord Henry, I am not at all        
\par surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked."               
\par   "But what world says that?" asked Lord Henry, elevating his               
\par eyebrows. "It can only be the next world. This world and I are on           
\par excellent terms."                                                           
\par   "Everybody I know says you are very wicked," cried the old lady,          
\par shaking her head.                                                           
\par   Lord Henry looked serious for some moments. "It is perfectly              
\par monstrous," he said, at last, "the way people go about nowadays saying      
\par things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and                
\par entirely true."                                                             
\par   "Isn't he incorrigible?" cried Dorian, leaning forward in his chair.      
\par   "I hope so," said his hostess, laughing. "But really if you all           
\par worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry      
\par again so as to be in the fashion."                                          
\par   "You will never marry again, Lady Narborough," broke in Lord              
\par Henry. "You were far too happy. When a woman marries again it is            
\par because she detested her first husband. When a man marries again, it        
\par is because he adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk         
\par theirs."                                                                    
\par   "Narborough wasn't perfect," cried the old lady.                          
\par   "If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady," was         
\par the rejoinder. "Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of         
\par them they will forgive us everything, even our intellects. You will         
\par never ask me to dinner again, after saying this, I am afraid, Lady          
\par Narborough; but it is quite true."                                          
\par   "Of course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you           
\par for your defects, where would you all be? Not one of you would ever be      
\par married. You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not, however,         
\par that that would alter you much. Nowadays all the married men live like      
\par bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men."                         
\par   "Fin de siecle," murmured Lord Henry.                                     
\par   "Fin du globe," answered his hostess.                                     
\par   "I wish it were fin du globe," said Dorian, with a sigh. "Life is         
\par a great disappointment."                                                    
\par   "Ah, my dear," cried Lady Narborough, putting on her gloves,              
\par "don't tell me that you have exhausted Life. When a man says that           
\par one knows that Life has exhausted him. Lord Henry is very wicked,           
\par and I sometimes wish that I had been; but you are made to be good- you      
\par look so good. I must find you a nice wife. Lord Henry, don't you think      
\par that Mr. Gray should get married?"                                          
\par   "I am always telling him so, Lady Narborough," said Lord Henry, with      
\par a bow.                                                                      
\par   "Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him. I shall go          
\par through Debrett carefully to-night. and draw out a list of all the          
\par eligible young ladies."                                                     
\par   "With their ages, Lady Narborough?" asked Dorian.                         
\par   "Of course, with their ages, slightly edited. But nothing must be         
\par done in a hurry. I want it to be what The Morning Post calls a              
\par suitable alliance, and I want you both to be happy."                        
\par   "What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!" exclaimed Lord         
\par Henry. "A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love      
\par her."                                                                       
\par   "Ah! what a cynic you are!" cried the old lady, pushing back her          
\par chair, and nodding to Lady Ruxton. "You must come and dine with me          
\par soon again. You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what        
\par Sir Andrew prescribes for me. You must tell me what people you would        
\par like to meet, though. I want it to be a delightful gathering."              
\par   "I like men who have a future, and women who have a past," he             
\par answered. "Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party?"           
\par   "I fear so," she said, laughing, as she stood up. "A thousand             
\par pardons, my dear Lady Ruxton," she added, "I didn't see you hadn't          
\par finished your cigarette."                                                   
\par   "Never mind, Lady Narborough. I smoke a great deal too much. I am         
\par going to limit myself, for the future."                                     
\par   "Pray don't, Lady Ruxton," said Lord Henry. "Moderation is a fatal        
\par thing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a         
\par feast."                                                                     
\par   Lady Ruxton glanced at him curiously. "You must come and explain          
\par that to me some afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a fascinating              
\par theory," she murmured, as she swept out of the room.                        
\par   "Now, mind you don't stay too long over your politics and                 
\par scandal," cried Lady Narborough from the door. "If you do, we are sure      
\par to squabble upstairs."                                                      
\par   The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of         
\par the table and came up to the top. Dorian Gray changed his seat, and         
\par went and sat by Lord Henry. Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud             
\par voice about the situation in the House of Commons. He guffawed at           
\par his adversaries. The word doctrinaire- word full of terror to the           
\par British mind- reappeared from time to time between his explosions.          
\par An alliterative prefix served as an ornament of oratory. He hoisted         
\par the Union Jack on the pinnacles of Thought. The inherited stupidity of      
\par the race- sound English common sense he jovially termed it- was             
\par shown to be the proper bulwark for Society.                                 
\par   A smile curved Lord Henry's lips, and he turned round and looked          
\par at Dorian.                                                                  
\par   "Are you better, my dear fellow?" he asked. "You seemed rather out        
\par of sorts at dinner."                                                        
\par   "I am quite well, Harry. I am tired. That is all."                        
\par   "You were charming last night. The little Duchess is quite devoted        
\par to you. She tells me she is going down to Selby."                           
\par   "She has promised to come on the twentieth."                              
\par   "Is Monmouth to be there too?"                                            
\par   "Oh, yes, Harry."                                                         
\par   "He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. She is very      
\par clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of          
\par weakness. It is the feet of clay that makes the gold of the image           
\par precious. Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay.          
\par White porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the fire,         
\par and what fire does not destroy, it hardens. She has had experiences."       
\par   "How long has she been married?" asked Dorian.                            
\par   "An eternity, she tells me. I believe, according to the peerage,          
\par it is ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like            
\par eternity, with time thrown in. Who else is coming?"                         
\par   "Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey      
\par Clouston, the usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian."                       
\par   "I like him," said Lord Henry. "A great many people don't, but I          
\par find him charming. He atones for being occasionally somewhat                
\par over-dressed, by being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very        
\par modern type."                                                               
\par   "I don't know if he will be able to come, Harry. He may have to go        
\par to Monte Carlo with his father."                                            
\par   "Ah! what a nuisance people's people are! Try and make him come.          
\par By the way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night. You left before      
\par eleven. What did you do afterwards? Did you go straight home?"              
\par   Dorian glanced at him hurriedly, and frowned. "No, Harry," he said        
\par at last, "I did not get home till nearly three."                            
\par   "Did you go to the club?"                                                 
\par   "Yes," he answered. Then he bit his lip. "No, I don't mean that. I        
\par didn't go to the club. I walked about. I forget what I did.... How          
\par inquisitive you are, Harry! You always want to know what one has            
\par been doing. I always want to forget what I have been doing. I came          
\par in at half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time. I had left my      
\par latchkey at home, and my servant had to let me in. If you want any          
\par corroborative evidence on the subject you can ask him."                     
\par   Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. "My dear fellow, as if I cared!        
\par Let us go up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.        
\par Something has happened to you, Dorian. Tell me what it is. You are not      
\par yourself to-night."                                                         
\par   "Don't mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper. I shall         
\par come round and see you to-morrow or next day. Make my excuses to Lady.      
\par Narborough. I sha'n't go upstairs. I shall go home. I must go home."        
\par   "All right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at               
\par tea-time. The Duchess is coming."                                           
\par   "I will try to be there, Harry," he said, leaving the room. As he         
\par drove back to his own house he was conscious that the sense of              
\par terror he thought he had strangled had come back to him. Lord               
\par Henry's casual questioning had made him lose his nerves for the             
\par moment, and he wanted his nerve still. Things that were dangerous           
\par had to be destroyed. He winced. He hated the idea of even touching          
\par them.                                                                       
\par   Yet it had to be done. He realized that, and when he had locked           
\par the door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he           
\par had thrust Basil Hallward's coat and bag. A huge fire was blazing.          
\par He piled another log on it. The smell of singeing clothes and               
\par burning leather was horrible. It took him three-quarters of an hour to      
\par consume everything. At the end he felt faint and sick, and having           
\par lit some Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his      
\par hands and forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.                        
\par   Suddenly he started. His eyes grew strangely bright and he gnawed         
\par nervously at his under-lip. Between two of the windows stood a large        
\par Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony, and inlaid with ivory and            
\par blue lapis. He watched it as though it were a thing that could              
\par fascinate and make afraid, as though it held something that he              
\par longed for and yet almost loathed. His breath quickened. A mad craving      
\par came over him. He lit a cigarette and then threw it away. His               
\par eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek.      
\par But he still watched the cabinet. At last he got up from the sofa on        
\par which he had been lying, went over to it, and, having unlocked it,          
\par touched some hidden spring. A triangular drawer passed slowly out. His      
\par fingers moved instinctively towards it, dipped in, and closed on            
\par something. It was a small Chinese box of black and gold-dust                
\par lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides patterned with curved waves,        
\par and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited      
\par metal threads. He opened it. Inside was a green paste waxy in               
\par lustre, the odour curiously heavy and persistent.                           
\par   He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile            
\par upon his face. Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was        
\par terribly hot, he drew himself up, and glanced at the clock. It was          
\par twenty minutes to twelve. He put the box back, shutting the cabinet         
\par doors as he did so, and went into his bedroom.                              
\par   As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian          
\par Gray, dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat,        
\par crept quietly out of his house. In Bond Street he found a hansom            
\par with a good horse. He hailed it, and in a low voice gave the driver an      
\par address.                                                                    
\par   The man shook his head. "It is too far for me," he muttered.              
\par   "Here is a sovereign for you," said Dorian. "You shall have               
\par another if you drive fast."                                                 
\par   "All right, sir," answered the man, "you will be there in an              
\par hour," and after his fare had got in he turned his horse round, and         
\par drove rapidly towards the river.                                            
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                              CHAPTER XVI                                    
\par -                                                                           
\par   A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked            
\par ghastly in the dripping mist. The public-houses were just closing, and      
\par dim men and women were clustering in broken groups round their              
\par doors. From some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter. In        
\par others, drunkards brawled and screamed.                                     
\par   Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead,          
\par Dorian Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great        
\par city, and now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord           
\par Henry had said to him on the first day they had met, "To cure the soul      
\par by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul." Yes,          
\par that was the secret. He had often tried it, and would try it again          
\par now. There were opium-dens, where one could buy oblivion, dens of           
\par horror where the memory of old sins could be destroyed by the               
\par madness of sins that were new.                                              
\par   The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to            
\par time a huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it.         
\par The gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once      
\par the man lost his way, and had to drive back half a mile. A steam            
\par rose from the horse as it splashed up the puddles. The side-windows of      
\par the hansom were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.                           
\par   "To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of      
\par the soul!" How the words rang in his ears! His soul, certainly, was         
\par sick to death. Was it true that the senses could cure it? Innocent          
\par blood had been spilt. What could atone for that? Ah! for that there         
\par was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness      
\par was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the           
\par thing out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung          
\par one. Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had           
\par done? Who had made him a judge over others? He had said things that         
\par were dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.                                 
\par   On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at          
\par each step. He thrust up the trap, and called to the man to drive            
\par faster. The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him. His              
\par throat burned, and his delicate hands twitched nervously together.          
\par He struck at the horse madly with his stick. The driver laughed, and        
\par whipped up. He laughed in answer, and the man was silent.                   
\par   The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of        
\par some sprawling spider. The monotony became unbearable, and, as the          
\par mist thickened, he felt afraid.                                             
\par   Then they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter here,         
\par and he could see the strange bottle-shaped kilns with their orange          
\par fan-like tongues of fire. A dog barked as they went by, and far away        
\par in the darkness some wandering seagull screamed. The horse stumbled in      
\par a rut, then swerved aside, and broke into a gallop.                         
\par   After some time they left the clay road, and rattled again over           
\par rough-paven streets. Most of the windows were dark, but now and then        
\par fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamp-lit blind. He          
\par watched them curiously. They moved like monstrous marionettes, and          
\par made gestures like live things. He hated them. A dull rage was in           
\par his heart. As they turned a corner a woman yelled something at them         
\par from an open door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a             
\par hundred yards. The driver beat at them with his whip.                       
\par   It is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly            
\par with hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and            
\par reshaped those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he         
\par had found in them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and         
\par justified, by intellectual approval, passions that without such             
\par justification would still have dominated his temper. From cell to cell      
\par of his brain crept the one thought; and the wild desire to live,            
\par most terrible of all man's appetites, quickened into force each             
\par trembling nerve and fibre. Ugliness that had once been hateful to           
\par him because it made things real, became dear to him now for that            
\par very reason. Ugliness was the one reality. The coarse brawl, the            
\par loathsome den, the crude vileness of disordered life, the very              
\par vileness of thief and outcast, were more vivid, in their intense            
\par actuality of impression, than all the gracious shapes of Art, the           
\par dreamy shadows of Song. They were what he needed for forgetfulness. In      
\par three days he would be free.                                                
\par   Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane. Over      
\par the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black        
\par masts of ships. Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to           
\par the yards.                                                                  
\par   "Somewhere about here, sir, ain't it?" he asked huskily through           
\par the trap.                                                                   
\par   Dorian started, and peered round. "This will do," he answered,            
\par and, having got out hastily, and given the driver the extra fare he         
\par had promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay. Here      
\par and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman. The      
\par light shook and splintered in the puddles. A red glare came from an         
\par outward-bound steamer that was coaling. The slimy pavement looked like      
\par a wet mackintosh.                                                           
\par   He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if      
\par he was being followed. In about seven or eight minutes he reached a         
\par small shabby house, that was wedged in between two gaunt factories. In      
\par one of the top windows stood a lamp. He stopped, and gave a peculiar        
\par knock.                                                                      
\par   After a little while he heard steps in the passage, and the chain         
\par being unhooked. The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying      
\par a word to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself upon the         
\par shadow as he passed. At the end of the hall hung a tattered green           
\par curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him      
\par in from the street. He dragged it aside, and entered a long, low            
\par room which looked as if it had once been a third-rate                       
\par dancing-saloon. Shrill flaring gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the        
\par fly-blown mirrors that faced them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy      
\par reflectors of ribbed tin backed them, making quivering discs of light.      
\par The floor was covered with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and        
\par there into mud, and stained with rings of spilt liquor. Some Malays         
\par were crouching by a little charcoal stove playing with bone                 
\par counters, and showing their white teeth as they chattered. In one           
\par corner with his head buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a           
\par table, and by the tawdrily-painted bar that ran across one complete         
\par side stood two haggard women mocking an old man who was brushing the        
\par sleeves of his coat with an expression of disgust. "He thinks he's got      
\par red ants on him," laughed one of them, as Dorian passed by. The man         
\par looked at her in terror, and began to whimper.                              
\par   At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a         
\par darkened chamber. As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the         
\par heavy odour of opium met him. He heaved a deep breath, and his              
\par nostrils quivered with pleasure. When he entered, a young man with          
\par smooth yellow hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin        
\par pipe, looked up at him, and nodded in a hesitating manner.                  
\par   "You here, Adrian?" muttered Dorian.                                      
\par   "Where else should I be?" he answered, listlessly. "None of the           
\par chaps will speak to me now."                                                
\par   "I thought you had left England."                                         
\par   "Darlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the bill at      
\par last. George doesn't speak to me either.... I don't care," he added,        
\par with a sigh. "As long as one has this stuff, one doesn't want friends.      
\par I think I have had too many friends."                                       
\par   Dorian winced, and looked around at the grotesque things that lay in      
\par such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs,        
\par the gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him. He          
\par knew in what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull             
\par hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy. They were              
\par better off than he was. He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a          
\par horrible malady, was eating his soul away. From time to time he seemed      
\par to see the eyes of Basil Hallward looking at him. Yet he felt he could      
\par not stay. The presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him. He wanted          
\par to be where no one would know who he was. He wanted to escape from          
\par himself.                                                                    
\par   "I am going on to the other place," he said, after a pause.               
\par   "On the wharf?"                                                           
\par   "Yes."                                                                    
\par   "That mad-cat is sure to be there. They won't have her in this place      
\par now."                                                                       
\par   Dorian shrugged his shoulders. "I am sick of women who love one.          
\par Women who hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is         
\par better."                                                                    
\par   "Much the same."                                                          
\par   "I like it better. Come and have something to drink. I must have          
\par something."                                                                 
\par   "I don't want anything," murmured the young man.                          
\par   "Never mind."                                                             
\par   Adrian Singleton rose up wearily, and followed Dorian to the bar.         
\par A half caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a             
\par hideous greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in        
\par front of them. The women sidled up, and began to chatter. Dorian            
\par turned his back on them, and said something in a low voice to Adrian        
\par Singleton.                                                                  
\par   A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one      
\par of the women. "We're very proud to-night," she sneered.                     
\par   "For God's sake don't talk to me," cried Dorian, stamping his foot        
\par on the ground. "What do you want? Money? Here it is. Don't ever talk        
\par to me again."                                                               
\par   Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman's sodden eyes, then      
\par flickered out, and left them dull and glazed. She tossed her head, and      
\par raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers. Her companion          
\par watched her enviously.                                                      
\par   "It's no use," sighed Adrian Singleton "I don't care to go back.          
\par What does it matter? I am quite happy here."                                
\par   "You will write to me if you want anything, won't you?" said Dorian,      
\par after a pause.                                                              
\par   "Perhaps."                                                                
\par   "Good-night, then."                                                       
\par   "Good-night," answered the young man, passing up the steps, and           
\par wiping his parched mouth with a handkerchief.                               
\par   Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face. As he          
\par drew the curtain aside a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips          
\par of the woman who had taken the money. "There goes the devil's               
\par bargain!" she hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.                                
\par   "Curse you," he answered, "don't call me that."                           
\par   She snapped her fingers. "Prince Charming is what you like to be          
\par called, ain't it?" she yelled after him.                                    
\par   The drowsy sailor leapt to his feet as she spoke, and looked              
\par wildly round. The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his        
\par ear. He rushed out as if in pursuit.                                        
\par   Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain. His        
\par meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered      
\par if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door, as        
\par Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult. He bit           
\par his lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad. Yet, after all, what      
\par did it matter to him? One's days were too brief to take the burden          
\par of another's errors on one's shoulders. Each man lived his own life,        
\par and paid his own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay      
\par so often for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again,            
\par indeed. In her dealings with man Destiny never closed her accounts.         
\par   There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for            
\par sin, or for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature, that           
\par every fibre of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be            
\par instinct with fearful impulses. Men and women at such moments lose the      
\par freedom of their will. They move to their terrible end as automatons        
\par move. Choice is taken from them, and conscience is either killed,           
\par or, if it lives at all, lives but to give rebellion its fascination,        
\par and disobedience its charm. For all sins, as theologians weary not          
\par of reminding us, are sins of disobedience. When that high spirit, that      
\par morning-star of evil, fell from heaven, it was as a rebel that he           
\par fell.                                                                       
\par   Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry         
\par for rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his steps as he          
\par went, but as he darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him        
\par often as a short cut to the ill-famed place where he was going, he          
\par felt himself suddenly seized from behind, and before he had time to         
\par defend himself he was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand      
\par round his throat.                                                           
\par   He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the        
\par tightening fingers away. In a second he heard the click of a revolver,      
\par and saw the gleam of a polished barrel pointing straight at his             
\par head, and the dusky form of a short thick-set man facing him.               
\par   "What do you want?" he gasped.                                            
\par   "Keep quiet," said the man. "If you stir, I shoot you."                   
\par   "You are mad. What have I done to you?"                                   
\par   "You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane," was the answer, "and Sibyl          
\par Vane was my sister. She killed herself. I know it. Her death is at          
\par your door. I swore I would kill you in return. For years I have sought      
\par you. I had no clue, no trace. The two people who could have                 
\par described you were dead. I knew nothing of you but the pet name she         
\par used to call you. I heard it to-night by chance. Make your peace            
\par with God, for to-night you are going to die."                               
\par   Dorian Gray grew sick with fear. "I never knew her," he stammered.        
\par "I never heard of her. You are mad."                                        
\par   "You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane,         
\par you are going to die." There was a horrible moment. Dorian did not          
\par know what to say or do. "Down on your knees!" growled the man. "I give      
\par you one minute to make your peace- no more. I go on board to-night for      
\par India, and I must do my job first. One minute. That's all."                 
\par   Dorian's arms fell to his side. Paralyzed with terror, he did not         
\par know what to do. Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain.             
\par "Stop," he cried. "How long ago is it since your sister died? Quick,        
\par tell me!"                                                                   
\par   "Eighteen years," said the man. "Why do you ask me? What do years         
\par matter?"                                                                    
\par   "Eighteen years," laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in         
\par his voice. "Eighteen years! Set me under the lamp and look at my            
\par face."                                                                      
\par   James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant.      
\par Then he seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway.                
\par   Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to            
\par show him the hideous  error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen,        
\par for the face of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of          
\par boyhood, all the unstained purity of youth. He seemed little more than      
\par a lad of twenty summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than         
\par his sister had been when they had parted so many years ago. It was          
\par obvious that this was not the man who had destroyed her life.               
\par   He loosened his hold and reeled back. "My God! my God!" he cried,         
\par "and I would have murdered you!"                                            
\par   Dorian Gray drew a long breath. "You have been on the brink of            
\par committing a terrible crime, my man," he said, looking at him sternly.      
\par "Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own           
\par hands."                                                                     
\par   "Forgive me, sir," muttered James Vane. "I was deceived. A chance         
\par word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track."                 
\par   "You had better go home, and put that pistol away, or you may get         
\par into trouble," said Dorian, turning on his heel, and going slowly down      
\par the street.                                                                 
\par   James Vane stood on the pavement in horror. He was trembling from         
\par head to foot. After a little while a black shadow that had been             
\par creeping along the dripping wall, moved out into the light and came         
\par close to him with stealthy footsteps. He felt a hand laid on his arm        
\par and looked round with a start. It was one of the women who had been         
\par drinking at the bar.                                                        
\par   "Why didn't you kill him?" she hissed out, putting her haggard            
\par face quite close to his. "I knew you were following him when you            
\par rushed out from Daly's. You fool! You should have killed him. He has        
\par lots of money, and he's as bad as bad."                                     
\par   "He is not the man I am looking for," he answered, "and I want no         
\par man's money. I want a man's life. The man whose life I want must be         
\par nearly forty now. This one is little more than a boy. Thank God, I          
\par have not got his blood upon my hands."                                      
\par   The woman gave a bitter laugh. "Little more than a boy!" she              
\par sneered. "Why, man, it's nigh on eighteen years since Prince                
\par Charming made me what I am."                                                
\par   "You lie!" cried James Vane.                                              
\par   She raised her hand up to heaven. "Before God I am telling the            
\par truth," she cried.                                                          
\par   "Before God?"                                                             
\par   "Strike me dumb if it ain't so. He is the worst one that comes here.      
\par They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face. It's nigh      
\par on eighteen years since I met him. He hasn't changed much since             
\par then. I have though," she added with a sickly leer.                         
\par   "You swear this?"                                                         
\par   "I swear it," came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth. "But don't         
\par give me away to him," she whined; "I am afraid of him. Let me have          
\par some money for my night's lodging."                                         
\par   He broke from her with an oath, and rushed to the corner of the           
\par street, but Dorian Gray had disappeared. When he looked back, the           
\par woman had vanished also.                                                    
\par

\par   A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby         
\par Royal talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her husband,      
\par a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests. It was tea-time,      
\par and the mellow light of the huge lace-covered lamp that stood on the        
\par table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service          
\par at which the Duchess was presiding. Her white hands were moving             
\par daintily among the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at              
\par something that Dorian had whispered to her. Lord Henry was lying            
\par back in a silk-draped wicker chair looking at them. On a                    
\par peach-coloured divan sat Lady Narborough pretending to listen to the        
\par Duke's description of the last Brazilian beetle that he had added to        
\par his collection. Three young men in elaborate smoking-suits were             
\par handing tea-cakes to some of the women. The house-party consisted of        
\par twelve people, and there were more expected to arrive on the next day.      
\par   "What are you two talking about?" said Lord Henry, strolling over to      
\par the table, and putting his cup down. "I hope Dorian has told you about      
\par my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a delightful            
\par idea."                                                                      
\par   "But I don't want to be rechristened, Harry," rejoined the                
\par Duchess, looking up at him with her wonderful eyes. "I am quite             
\par satisfied with my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied      
\par with his."                                                                  
\par   "My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world. They        
\par are both perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday I cut        
\par an orchid, for my buttonhole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as         
\par effective as the seven deadly sins. In a thoughtless moment I asked         
\par one of the gardeners what it was called. He told me that it was a fine      
\par specimen of Rooinsoniana, or something dreadful of that kind. It is         
\par a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to         
\par things. Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one          
\par quarrel is with words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in          
\par literature. The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled      
\par to use one. It is the only thing he is fit for."                            
\par   "Then what should we call you, Harry?" she asked.                         
\par   "His name is Prince Paradox," said Dorian.                                
\par   "I recognize him in a flash," exclaimed the Duchess.                      
\par   "I won't hear of it," laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a chair.           
\par "From a label there is no escape! I refuse the title."                      
\par   "Royalties may not abdicate," fell as a warning from pretty lips.         
\par   "You wish me to defend my throne, then?"                                  
\par   "Yes."                                                                    
\par   "I give the truths of to-morrow."                                         
\par   "I prefer the mistakes of to-day," she answered.                          
\par   "You disarm me, Gladys," he cried, catching the wilfulness of her         
\par mood.                                                                       
\par   "Of your shield, Harry: not of your spear."                               
\par   "I never tilt against Beauty," he said, with a wave of his hand.          
\par   "That is your error, Harry, believe me. You value beauty far too          
\par much."                                                                      
\par   "How can you say that, I admit that I think that it is better to          
\par be beautiful than to be good. But on the other hand no one is more          
\par ready than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be      
\par ugly?"                                                                      
\par   "Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?" cried the Duchess.      
\par "What becomes of your simile about the orchid?"                             
\par   "Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys. You, as a good      
\par Tory, must not underrate them. Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly        
\par virtues have made our England what she is."                                 
\par   "You don't like your country, then?" she asked.                           
\par   "I live in it."                                                           
\par   "That you may censure it the better."                                     
\par   "Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?" he enquired.        
\par   "What do they say of us?"

\par   "I could not use it. It is too true."                                     
\par   "You need not be afraid. Our countrymen never recognize a

\par   "They are more cunning than practical. When they make up their            
\par ledger, they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy."           
\par   "Still, we have done great things."                                       
\par   "Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys."                            
\par   "We have carried their burden."                                           
\par   "Only as far as the Stock Exchange."                                      
\par   She shook her head. "I believe in the race," she cried.                   
\par   "It represents the survival of the pushing."

\par colouring. "I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely          
\par scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern

\par   "Oh! my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with

\par   "And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?"                  
\par   "For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you. Usually             
\par because I come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be        
\par dressed by half-past eight."                                                
\par   "How unreasonable of her! You should give her warning."                   
\par   "I daren't, Mr. Gray. Why, she invents hats for me. You remember the      
\par one I wore at Lady Hilstone's garden-party? You don't, but it is            
\par nice of you to pretend that you do. Well, she made it out of                
\par nothing. All good hats are made out of nothing."                            
\par   "Like all good reputations, Gladys," interrupted Lord Henry.              
\par "Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular           
\par one must be a mediocrity."                                                  
\par   "Not with women," said the Duchess, shaking her head, "and women          
\par rule the world. I assure you we can't bear mediocrities. We women,          
\par as some one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your        
\par eyes, if you ever love at all."                                             
\par   "It seems to me that we never do anything else," murmured Dorian.         
\par   "Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray," answered the Duchess,        
\par with mock sadness.                                                          
\par   "My dear Gladys!" cried Lord Henry. "How can you say that? Romance        
\par lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an            
\par art. Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever        
\par loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It        
\par merely intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at      
\par best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as             
\par often as possible."                                                         
\par   "Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?" asked the Duchess,         
\par after a pause.                                                              
\par   "Especially when one has been wounded by it," answered Lord Henry.        
\par   The Duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious               
\par expression in her eyes. "What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?" she            
\par enquired.                                                                   
\par   Dorian hesitated a moment. Then he threw back his head and                
\par laughed. "I always agree with Harry, Duchess."                              
\par   "Even when he is wrong?"                                                  
\par   "Harry is never wrong, Duchess."                                          
\par   "And does his philosophy make you happy?"                                 
\par   "I have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I have         
\par searched for pleasure."                                                     
\par   "And found it, Mr. Gray?"                                                 
\par   "Often. Too often."                                                       
\par   The Duchess sighed. "I am searching for peace," she said, "and if         
\par I don't go and dress, I shall have none this evening."                      
\par   "Let me get you some orchids, Duchess," cried Dorian, starting to         
\par his feet, and walking down the conservatory.                                
\par   "You are flirting disgracefully with him," said Lord Henry to his         
\par cousin. "You had better take care. He is very fascinating."                 
\par   "If he were not, there would be no battle."                               
\par   "Greek meets Greek then?"                                                 
\par   "I am on the side of the Trojans. They fought for a woman."               
\par   "They were defeated."                                                     
\par   "There are worse things than capture," she answered.                      
\par   "You gallop with a loose rein."                                           
\par   "Pace gives life," was the riposte. "I shall write it in my diary         
\par to-night."                                                                  
\par   "What?"

\par   "I am not even singed. My wings are untouched."                           
\par   "You use them for everything, except flight."                             
\par   "Courage has passed from men to women. It is a new experience for

\par   "Who?"                                                                    
\par   He laughed. "Lady Narborough," he whispered. "She perfectly adores        
\par him."                                                                       
\par   "You fill me with apprehension. The appeal to Antiquity is fatal          
\par to us who are romanticists."                                                
\par   "Romanticists! You have all the methods of science."                      
\par   "Men have educated us."                                                   
\par   "But not explained you."                                                  
\par   "Describe us as a sex," was her challenge.                                
\par   "Sphinxes without secrets."                                               
\par   She looked at him, smiling. "How long Mr. Gray is!" she said. "Let        
\par us go and help him. I have not yet told him the colour of my frock."        
\par   "Ah! you must suit your frock to his flowers, Gladys."                    
\par   "That would be a premature surrender."

\par   "They found safety in the desert. I could not do that."                   
\par   "Women are not always allowed a choice," he answered, but hardly had      
\par he finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory        
\par came a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall.           
\par Everybody started up. The Duchess stood motionless in horror. And with      
\par fear in his eyes Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms, to find      
\par Dorian Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a death-like         
\par swoon.                                                                      
\par   He was carried at once into the blue drawing-room, and laid upon one      
\par of the sofas. After a short time he came to himself, and looked             
\par round with a dazed expression.                                              
\par   "What has happened?" he asked. "Oh! I remember. Am I safe here,           
\par Harry,?" He began to tremble.                                               
\par   "My dear Dorian," answered Lord Henry, "you merely fainted. That was      
\par all. You must have overtired yourself. You had better not come down to      
\par dinner. I will take your place."                                            
\par   "No, I will come down," he said, struggling to his feet. "I would         
\par rather come down. I must not be alone."                                     
\par   He went to his room and dressed. There was a wild recklessness of         
\par gaiety in his manner as he sat at table, but now and then a thrill          
\par of terror ran through him when he remembered that, pressed against the      
\par window of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief, he had seen the      
\par face of James Vane watching him.                                            
\par                                                                             
\par                                                                             
\par                             CHAPTER XVIII                                   
\par -                                                                           
\par   The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most          
\par of the time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet      
\par indifferent to life itself. The consciousness of being hunted, snared,      
\par tracked down, had begun to dominate him. If the tapestry did but            
\par tremble in the wind, he shook. The dead leaves that were blown against      
\par the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and          
\par wild regrets. When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor's            
\par face peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once         
\par more to lay its hand upon his heart.                                        
\par   But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out      
\par of the night, and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him.          
\par Actual life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the      
\par imagination. It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet        
\par of sin. It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen      
\par brood. In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor        
\par the good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust          
\par upon the weak. That was all. Besides, had any stranger been prowling        
\par round the house he would have been seen by the servants or the              
\par keepers. Had any footmarks been found on the flower-beds, the               
\par gardeners would have reported it. Yes: it had been merely fancy. Sibyl      
\par Vane's brother had not come back to kill him. He had sailed away in         
\par his ship to founder in some winter sea. From him, at any rate, he           
\par was safe. Why, the man did not know who he was, could not know who          
\par he was. The mask of youth had saved him.                                    
\par   And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to         
\par think that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them      
\par visible form, and make them move before one! What sort of life would        
\par his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to peer at him          
\par from silent corners, to mock him from secret places, to whisper in his      
\par ear as he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy fingers as he lay          
\par asleep! As the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with           
\par terror, and the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder.           
\par Oh! in what a wild hour of madness he had killed his friend! How            
\par ghastly the mere memory of the scene! He saw it all again. Each             
\par hideous detail came back to him with added horror. Out of the black         
\par cave of Time, terrible and swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his        
\par sin. When Lord Henry came in at six o'clock, he found him crying as         
\par one whose heart will break.                                                 
\par   It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out. There           
\par was something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning         
\par that seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for             
\par life. But it was not merely the physical conditions of environment          
\par that had caused the change. His own nature had revolted against the         
\par excess of anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of         
\par its calm. With subtle and finely-wrought temperaments it is always so.      
\par Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the      
\par man, or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The      
\par loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude.      
\par Besides, he had convinced himself that he had been the victim of a          
\par terror-stricken imagination, and looked back now on his fears with          
\par something of pity and not a little of contempt.                             
\par   After breakfast he walked with the Duchess for an hour in the             
\par garden, and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party. The      
\par crisp frost lay like salt upon the grass. The sky was an inverted           
\par cup of blue metal. A thin film of ice bordered the flat reed-grown          
\par lake.                                                                       
\par   At the corner of the pine wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey            
\par Clouston, the Duchess's brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of        
\par his gun. He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take         
\par the mare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered          
\par bracken and rough undergrowth.                                              
\par   "Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?" he asked.                            
\par   "Not very good, Dorian. I think most of the birds have gone to the        
\par open. I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new          
\par ground."                                                                    
\par   Dorian strolled along by his side. The keen aromatic air, the             
\par brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of        
\par the beaters ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of           
\par the guns that followed, fascinated him, and filled him with a sense of      
\par delightful freedom. He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness,      
\par by the high indifference of joy.                                            
\par   Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass, some twenty yards in          
\par front of them, with black-tipped ears erect, and long hinder limbs          
\par throwing it forward, started a hare. It bolted for a thicket of             
\par alders. Sir Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was             
\par something in the animal's grace of movement that strangely charmed          
\par Dorian Gray, and he cried out at once, "Don't shoot it, Geoffrey.           
\par Let it live."                                                               
\par   "What nonsense, Dorian!" laughed his companion, and as the hare           
\par bounded into the thicket he fired. There were two cries heard, the cry      
\par of a hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which      
\par is worse.                                                                   
\par   "Good heavens! I have hit a beater!" exclaimed Sir Geoffrey. "What        
\par an ass the man was to get in front of the guns! Stop shooting               
\par there!" he called out at the top of his voice. "A man is hurt."             
\par   The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.                 
\par   "Where, sir? Where is he?" he shouted. At the same time the firing        
\par ceased along the line.                                                      
\par   "Here," answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.      
\par "Why on earth don't you keep your men back? Spoiled my shooting for         
\par the day."                                                                   
\par   Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing        
\par the lithe, swinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged,          
\par dragging a body after them into the sunlight. He turned away in             
\par horror. It seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went. He      
\par heard Sir Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative      
\par answer of the keeper. The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly        
\par alive with faces. There was the trampling of myriad feet, and the           
\par low buzz of voices. A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating           
\par through the boughs overhead.                                                
\par   After few moments, that were to him, in his perturbed state, like         
\par endless hours of pain, he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He              
\par started, and looked round.                                                  
\par   "Dorian," said Lord Henry, "I had better tell them that the shooting      
\par is stopped for to-day. It would not look well to go on."                    
\par   "I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry," he answered, bitterly.          
\par "The whole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man...?"                      
\par   He could not finish the sentence.                                         
\par   "I am afraid so," rejoined Lord Henry. "He got the whole charge of        
\par shot in his chest. He must have died almost instantaneously. Come; let      
\par us go home."                                                                
\par   They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly        
\par fifty yards without speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry, and         
\par said, with a heavy sigh, "It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen."        
\par   "What is?" asked Lord Henry. "Oh! this accident, I suppose. My            
\par dear fellow, it can't be helped. It was the man's own fault. Why did        
\par he get in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It is            
\par rather awkward for Geoffrey, of course. It does not do to pepper            
\par beaters. It makes people think that one is a wild shot. And Geoffrey        
\par is not; he shoots very straight. But there is no use talking about the      
\par matter."                                                                    
\par   Dorian shook his head. "It is a bad omen, Harry. I feel as if             
\par something horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself,           
\par perhaps," he added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture          
\par of pain.                                                                    
\par   The elder man laughed. "The only horrible thing in the world is           
\par ennui, Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no                    
\par forgiveness. But we are not likely to suffer from it, unless these          
\par fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner. I must tell them        
\par that the subject is to be tabooed. As for omens, there is no such           
\par thing as an omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or      
\par too cruel for that. Besides, what on earth could happen to you,             
\par Dorian? You have everything in the world that a man can want. There is      
\par no one who would not be delighted to change places with you."               
\par   "There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry. Don't        
\par laugh like that. I am telling you the truth. The wretched peasant           
\par who has just died is better off than I am. I have no terror of              
\par Death. It is the coming of Death that terrifies me. Its monstrous           
\par wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me. Good heavens! don't        
\par you see a man moving, behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for      
\par me?"                                                                        
\par   Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved          
\par hand was pointing. "Yes," he said, smiling, "I see the gardener             
\par waiting for you. I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish        
\par to have on the table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear        
\par fellow! You must come and see my doctor, when we get back to town."         
\par   Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching.        
\par The man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a            
\par hesitating manner, and then produced a letter, which he handed to           
\par his master. "Her Grace told me to wait for an answer," he murmured.         
\par   Dorian put the letter into his pocket. "Tell Her Grace that I am          
\par coming in," he said, coldly. The man turned round, and went rapidly in      
\par the direction of the house.                                                 
\par   "How fond women are of doing dangerous things!" laughed Lord              
\par Henry. "It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman      
\par will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are            
\par looking on."                                                                
\par   "How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the               
\par present instance you are quite astray. I like the Duchess very much,        
\par but I don't love her."                                                      
\par   "And the Duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, as you      
\par are so excellently matched."                                                
\par   "You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for         
\par scandal."                                                                   
\par   "The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty," said Lord           
\par Henry, lighting a cigarette.                                                
\par   "You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram."         
\par   "The world goes to the altar of its own accord," was the answer.          
\par   "I wish I could love," cried Dorian Gray, with a deep note of pathos      
\par in his voice. "But I seem to have lost the passion, and forgotten           
\par the desire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own personality        
\par has become a burden to me. I want to escape, to go away, to forget. It      
\par was silly of me to come down here at all. I think I shall send a            
\par wire to Harvey to have the yacht got ready. On a yacht one is safe."        
\par   "Safe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell me         
\par what it is? You know I would help you."                                     
\par   "I can't tell you, Harry," he answered, sadly. "And I dare say it is      
\par only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me. I have a      
\par horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me."         
\par   "What nonsense!"                                                          
\par   "I hope it is, but I can't help feeling it. Ah! here is the Duchess,      
\par looking the Artemis in a tailor-made gown. You see we have come             
\par back, Duchess."                                                             
\par   "I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray," she answered. "Poor                
\par Geoffrey is terribly upset. And it seems that you asked him not to          
\par shoot the hare. How curious!"                                               
\par   "Yes, it was very curious. I don't know what made me say it. Some         
\par whim, I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But         
\par I am sorry they told you about the man. It is a hideous subject."           
\par   "It is an annoying subject," broke in Lord Henry. "It has no              
\par psychological value at all. Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on           
\par purpose, how interesting he would be! I should like to know some one        
\par who had committed a real murder."                                           
\par   "How horrid of you, Harry!" cried the Duchess. "Isn't it, Mr.             
\par Gray? Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He is going to faint."                  
\par   Dorian drew himself up with an effort, and smiled. "It is nothing,        
\par Duchess," he murmured; "my nerves are dreadfully out of order. That is      
\par all. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I didn't hear what          
\par Harry said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some other time. I think      
\par I must go and lie down. You will excuse me, won't you?"                     
\par   They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the              
\par conservatory onto the terrace. As the glass door closed behind Dorian,      
\par Lord Henry turned and looked at the Duchess with his slumberous             
\par eyes. "Are you very much in love with him?" he asked.                       
\par   She did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape.      
\par "I wish I knew," she said at last.                                          
\par   He shook his head. "Knowledge would be fatal. It is the                   
\par uncertainty that charms one. A mist makes things wonderful."                
\par   "One may lose one's way."                                                 
\par   "All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys."                         
\par   "What is that?"                                                           
\par   "Disillusion."                                                            
\par   "It was my debut in life," she sighed.                                    
\par   "It came to you crowned."                                                 
\par   "I am tired of strawberry leaves."                                        
\par   "They become you."                                                        
\par   "Only in public."                                                         
\par   "You would miss them," said Lord Henry.                                   
\par   "I will not part with a petal."                                           
\par   "Monmouth has cars."                                                      
\par   "Old age is dull of hearing."                                             
\par   "Has he never been jealous?"                                              
\par   "I wish he had been."                                                     
\par   He glanced about as if in search of something. "What are you looking      
\par for?" she enquired.                                                         
\par   "The button from your foil," he answered. "You have dropped it."          
\par   She laughed. "I have still the mask."                                     
\par   "It makes your eyes lovelier," was his reply.                             
\par   She laughed again. Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet         
\par fruit.                                                                      
\par   Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with          
\par terror in every tingling fibre of his body. Life had suddenly become        
\par too hideous a burden for him to bear. The dreadful death of the             
\par unlucky beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed          
\par to him to prefigure death for himself also. He had nearly swooned at        
\par what Lord Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting.               
\par   At five o'clock he rang his bell for his servant, and gave him            
\par orders to pack his things for the night-express to town, and to have        
\par the brougham at the door by eight-thirty. He was determined not to          
\par sleep another night at Selby Royal. It was an ill-omened place.             
\par Death walked there in the sunlight. The grass of the forest had been        
\par spotted with blood.                                                         
\par   Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up      
\par to town to consult his doctor, and asking him to entertain his              
\par guests in his absence. As he was putting it into the envelope, a knock      
\par came to the door, and his valet informed him that the head-keeper           
\par wished to see him. He frowned, and bit his lip. "Send him in," he           
\par muttered, after some moments' hesitation.                                   
\par   As soon as the man entered Dorian pulled his cheque-book out of a         
\par drawer, and spread it out before him.                                       
\par   "I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this           
\par morning, Thornton?" he said, taking up a pen.                               
\par   "Yes, sir," answered the game-keeper.                                     
\par   "Was the poor fellow married? Had he any people dependent on him?"        
\par asked Dorian, looking bored. "If so, I should not like them to be left      
\par in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary."      
\par   "We don't know who he is, sir. That is what I took the liberty of         
\par coming to you about."                                                       
\par   "Don't know who he is?" said Dorian, listlessly. "What do you             
\par mean? Wasn't he one of your men?"                                           
\par   "No, sir. Never saw him before. Seems like a sailor, sir."                
\par   The pen dropped from Dorian Gray's hand, and he felt as if his heart      
\par had suddenly stopped beating. "A sailor?" he cried out. "Did you say a      
\par sailor?"                                                                    
\par   "Yes, sir. He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed          
\par on both arms, and that kind of thing."                                      
\par   "Was there anything found on him?" said Dorian, leaning forward           
\par and looking at the man with startled eyes. "Anything that would tell        
\par his name?"                                                                  
\par   "Some money, sir- not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name          
\par of any kind. A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of           
\par sailor we think."                                                           
\par   Dorian started to his feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him. He        
\par clutched at it madly. "Where is the body?" he exclaimed. "Quick! I          
\par must see it at once."                                                       
\par   "It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk don't like      
\par to have that sort of thing in their houses. They say a corpse brings        
\par bad luck."                                                                  
\par   "The Home Farm! Go there at once and meet me. Tell one of the grooms      
\par to bring my horse round. No. Never mind. I'll go to the stables             
\par myself. It will save time."                                                 
\par   In less than a quarter of an hour Dorian Gray was galloping down the      
\par long avenue as hard as he could go. The trees seemed to sweep past him      
\par in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across         
\par his path. Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly             
\par threw him. He lashed her across the neck with his crop. She cleft           
\par the dusky air like an arrow. The stones flew from her hoofs.                
\par   At last he reached the Home Farm. Two men were loitering in the           
\par yard. He leapt from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them.          
\par In the farthest stable a light was glimmering. Something seemed to          
\par tell him that the body was there, and he hurried to the door, and           
\par put his hand upon the latch.                                                
\par   There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of         
\par a discovery that would either make or mar his life. Then he thrust the      
\par door open, and entered.                                                     
\par   On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of         
\par a man dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers. A spotted      
\par handkerchief had been placed over the face. A coarse candle, stuck          
\par in a bottle, sputtered beside it.                                           
\par   Dorian Gray shuddered. He felt that his could not be the hand to          
\par take the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants      
\par to come to him.                                                             
\par   "Take that thing off the face. I wish to see it," he said, clutching      
\par at the door-post for support.                                               
\par   When the farm-servant had done so, he stepped forward. A cry of           
\par joy broke from his lips. The man who had been shot in the thicket           
\par was James Vane.                                                             
\par   He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body. As he rode      
\par home, his eyes were full of tears, for he knew that he was safe.            
\par                                                                             
\par

\par   "There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,"          
\par cried Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl          
\par filled with rose-water. "You are quite perfect. Pray, don't change."        
\par   Dorian Gray shook his head. "No, Harry, I have done too many              
\par dreadful things in my life. I am not going to do any more. I began          
\par my good actions yesterday."                                                 
\par   "Where were you yesterday?"                                               
\par   "In the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by myself."         
\par   "My dear boy," said Lord Henry, smiling, "anybody can be good in the      
\par country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people      
\par who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is         
\par not by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways        
\par by which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by           
\par being corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either,          
\par so they stagnate."                                                          
\par   "Culture and corruption," echoed Dorian. "I have known something          
\par of both. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found         
\par together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I             
\par think I have altered."                                                      
\par   "You have not yet told me what your good action was. Or did you           
\par say you had done more than one?" asked his companion, as he spilt into      
\par his plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries, and through      
\par a perforated shell-shaped spoon snowed white sugar upon them.               
\par   "I can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any one         
\par else. I spared somebody. It sounds vain, but you understand what I          
\par mean. She was quite beautiful, and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane. I           
\par think it was that which first attracted me to her. You remember Sibyl,      
\par don't you? How long ago that seems! Well, Hetty was not one of our own      
\par class, of course. She was simply a girl in a village. But I really          
\par loved her. I am quite sure that I loved her. All during this wonderful      
\par May that we have been having, I used to run down and see her two or         
\par three times a week. Yesterday she met me in a little orchard. The           
\par apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing.        
\par We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn. Suddenly I         
\par determined to leave her as flower-like as I had found her."                 
\par   "I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a          
\par thrill of real pleasure, Dorian," interrupted Lord Henry. "But I can        
\par finish your idyll for you. You gave her good advice, and broke her          
\par heart. That was the beginning of your reformation."                         
\par   "Harry, you are horrible! You mustn't say these dreadful things.          
\par Hetty's heart is not broken. Of course she cried, and all that. But         
\par there is no disgrace upon her. She can live, like Perdita, in her           
\par garden of mint and marigold."                                               
\par   "And weep over faithless Florizel," said Lord Henry, laughing, as he      
\par leant back in his chair. "My dear Dorian, you have the most                 
\par curiously boyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really          
\par contented now with any one of her own rank? I suppose she will be           
\par married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman. Well,           
\par the fact of having met you, and loved you, will teach her to despise        
\par her husband, and she will be wretched. From a moral point of view, I        
\par cannot say that I think much of your great renunciation. Even as a          
\par beginning, it is poor. Besides, how do you know that Hetty isn't            
\par floating at the present moment in some star-lit mill-pond, with lovely      
\par water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?                                       
\par   "I can't bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, and then               
\par suggest the most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don't      
\par care what you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor        
\par Hetty! As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at        
\par the window, like a spray of jasmine. Don't let us talk about it any         
\par more, and don't try to persuade me that the first good action I have        
\par done for years, the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever          
\par known, is really a sort of sin. I want to be better. I am going to be       
\par better. Tell me something about yourself. What is going on in town?         
\par I have not been to the club for days."                                      
\par   "The people are still discussing poor Basil's disappearance."             
\par   "I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,"          
\par said Dorian, pouring himself out some wine, and frowning slightly.          
\par   "My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks,         
\par and the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of         
\par having more than one topic every three months. They have been very          
\par fortunate lately, however. They have had my own divorce-case, and Alan      
\par Campbell's suicide. Now they have got the mysterious disappearance          
\par of an artist. Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey          
\par ulster who left for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of             
\par November was poor Basil, and the French police declare that Basil           
\par never arrived in Paris at all. I suppose in about a fortnight we shall      
\par be told that he has been seen in San Francisco. It is an odd thing,         
\par but every one who disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco. It        
\par must be a delightful city, and possess all the attractions of the next      
\par world."                                                                     
\par   "What do you think has happened to Basil?" asked Dorian, holding          
\par up his Burgundy against the light, and wondering how it was he could        
\par discuss the matter so calmly.                                               
\par   "I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it      
\par is no business of mine. If he is dead, I don't want to think about          
\par him. Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it."            
\par   "Why?" said the young man, wearily.                                       
\par   "Because," said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt         
\par trellis of an open vinaigrette box, "one can survive everything             
\par nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in         
\par the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away. Let us have our        
\par coffee in the music-room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The           
\par man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely. Poor              
\par Victoria! I was very fond of her. The house is rather lonely without        
\par her. Of course married life is merely a habit, a bad habit. But then        
\par one regrets the loss even of one's worst habits. Perhaps one regrets        
\par them the most. They are such an essential part of one's personality."       
\par   Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and, passing into           
\par the next room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray              
\par across the white and black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had          
\par been brought in, he stopped, and, looking over at Lord Henry, said,         
\par "Harry, did it ever occur to you that Basil was murdered?"                  
\par   Lord Henry yawned. "Basil was very popular, and always wore a             
\par Waterbury watch. Why should he have been murdered? He was not clever        
\par enough to have enemies. Of course he had a wonderful genius for             
\par painting. But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as          
\par possible. Basil was really rather dull. He only interested me once,         
\par and that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a wild                 
\par adoration for you, and that you were the dominant motive of his art."       
\par   "I was very fond of Basil," said Dorian, with a note of sadness in        
\par his voice. "But don't people say that he was murdered?"                     
\par   "Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all           
\par probable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not      
\par the sort of man to have gone to them. He had no curiosity. It was           
\par his chief defect."                                                          
\par   "What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered             
\par Basil?" said the younger man. He watched him intently after he had          
\par spoken.                                                                     
\par   "I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character        
\par that doesn't suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is        
\par crime. It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I am sorry if I        
\par hurt your vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime           
\par belongs exclusively to the lower orders. I don't blame them in the          
\par smallest degree. I should fancy that crime was to them what art is          
\par to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations."              
\par   "A method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a man         
\par who has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime            
\par again? Don't tell me that."                                                 
\par   "Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often," cried         
\par Lord Henry, laughing. "That is one of the most important secrets of         
\par life. I should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake. One         
\par should never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner.           
\par But let us pass from poor Basil. I wish I could believe that he had         
\par come to such a really romantic end as you suggest; but I can't. I dare      
\par say he fell into the Seine off an omnibus, and that the conductor           
\par hushed up the scandal. Yes: I should fancy that was his end. I see him      
\par now lying on his back under those dull-green waters with the heavy          
\par barges floating over him, and long weeds catching in his hair. Do           
\par you know, I don't think he would have done much more good work. During      
\par the last ten years his painting had gone off very much."                    
\par   Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and         
\par began to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large                  
\par grey-plumaged bird, with pink crest and tail, that was balancing            
\par itself upon a bamboo perch. As his pointed fingers touched it, it           
\par dropped the white scurf of crinkled lids over black glass-like eyes,        
\par and began to sway backwards and forwards.                                   
\par   "Yes," he continued, turning round, and taking his handkerchief           
\par out of his pocket; "his painting had quite gone off. It seemed to me        
\par to have lost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he ceased        
\par to be great friends, he ceased to be a great artist. What was it            
\par separated you? I suppose he bored you. If so, he never forgave you.         
\par It's a habit bores have. By the way, what has become of that wonderful      
\par portrait he did of you? I don't think I have ever seen it since he          
\par finished it. Oh! I remember your telling me years ago that you had          
\par sent it down to Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the         
\par way. You never got it back? What a pity! It was really a                    
\par masterpiece. I remember I wanted to buy it. I wish I had now. It            
\par belonged to Basil's best period. Since then, his work was that curious      
\par mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man      
\par to be called a representative British artist. Did you advertise for         
\par it? You should."                                                            
\par   "I forget," said Dorian. "I suppose I did. But I never really             
\par liked it. I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is               
\par hateful to me. Why do you talk of it? It used to remind me of those         
\par curious lines in some play- 'Hamlet,' I think- how do they run?-            
\par -                                                                           
\par                     "'Like the painting of a sorrow,                        
\par                   A face without a heart.'                                  
\par -                                                                           
\par Yes: that is what it was like."                                             
\par   Lord Henry laughed. "If a man treats life artistically, his brain is      
\par his heart," he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.                         
\par   Dorian Gray shook his head, and struck some soft chords on the            
\par piano. "'Like the painting of a sorrow?'" he repeated, "'a face             
\par without a heart.'"                                                          
\par   The elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes.           
\par "By the way, Dorian," he said, after a pause, "'what does it profit         
\par a man if he gain the whole world and lose'- how does the quotation          
\par run?- 'his own soul?'"                                                      
\par   The music jarred and Dorian Gray started, and stared at his               
\par friend. "Why do you ask me that, Harry?"                                    
\par   "My dear fellow," said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in              
\par surprise, "I asked you because I thought you might be able to give          
\par me an answer. That is all. I was going through the Park last Sunday,        
\par and close by the Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of                  
\par shabby-looking people listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I        
\par passed by, I heard the man yelling out that question to his                 
\par audience. It struck me as being rather dramatic. London is very rich        
\par in curious effects of that kind. A wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in      
\par a mackintosh, a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of           
\par dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by            
\par shrill, hysterical lips- it was really very good in its way, quite a        
\par suggestion. I thought of telling the prophet that Art had a soul,           
\par but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he would not have               
\par understood me."                                                             
\par   "Don't, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and      
\par sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is      
\par a soul in each one of us. I know it."                                       
\par   "Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?"                                 
\par   "Quite sure."                                                             
\par   "Ah! then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely         
\par certain about are never true. That is the fatality of Faith, and the        
\par lesson of Romance. How grave you are! Don't be so serious. What have        
\par you or I to do with the superstitions of our age? No: we have given up      
\par our belief in the soul. Play me something. Play me a nocturne, Dorian,      
\par and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your           
\par youth. You must have some secret. I am only ten years older than you        
\par are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow. You are really                
\par wonderful, Dorian. You have never looked more charming than you do          
\par to-night. You remind me of the day I saw you first. You were rather         
\par cheeky, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of        
\par course, but not in appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret.        
\par To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take          
\par exercise, get up early, or be respectable. Youth! There is nothing          
\par like it. It's absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth. The only            
\par people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much      
\par younger than myself. They seem in front of me. Life has revealed to         
\par them her latest wonder. As for the aged, I always contradict the aged.      
\par I do it on principle. If you ask them their opinion on something            
\par that happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current        
\par in 1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and          
\par knew absolutely nothing. How lovely that thing you are playing is! I        
\par wonder did Chopin write it at Majorca, with the sea weeping round           
\par the villa, and the salt spray dashing against the panes? It is              
\par marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that there is one art          
\par left to us that is not imitative! Don't stop. I want music to-night.        
\par It seems to me that you are the young Apollo, and that I am Marsyas         
\par listening to you. I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that even you          
\par know nothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but         
\par that one is young. I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity. Ah,           
\par Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have had! You         
\par have drunk deeply of everything. You have crushed the grapes against        
\par your palate. Nothing has been hidden from you. And it has all been          
\par to you no more than the sound of music. It has not marred you. You are      
\par still the same."                                                            
\par   "I am not the same, Harry."                                               
\par   "Yes: you are the same. I wonder what the rest of your life will be.      
\par Don't spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect type.         
\par Don't make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now. You need        
\par not shake your head: you know you are. Besides, Dorian, don't               
\par deceive yourself. Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a      
\par question of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which          
\par thought hides itself and passion has its dreams. You may fancy              
\par yourself safe, and think yourself strong. But a chance tone of              
\par colour in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had        
\par once loved and that brings subtle memories with it, a line from a           
\par forgotten poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a             
\par piece of music that you had ceased to play- I tell you, Dorian, that        
\par it is on things like these that our lives depend. Browning writes           
\par about that somewhere; but our own senses will imagine them for us.          
\par There are moments when the odour of lilas blanc passes suddenly across      
\par me, and I have to live the strangest month of my life over again. I         
\par wish I could change places with you, Dorian. The world has cried out        
\par against us both, but it has always worshipped you. It always will           
\par worship you. You are the type of what the age is searching for, and         
\par what it is afraid it has found. I am so glad that you have never            
\par done anything, never carved a statue, or painted a picture, or              
\par produced anything outside yourself! Life has been your art. You have        
\par set yourself to music. Your days are your sonnets."                         
\par   Dorian rose up from the piano, and passed his hand through his hair.      
\par "Yes, life has been exquisite," he murmured, "but I am not going to         
\par have the same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant           
\par things to me. You don't know everything about me. I think that if           
\par you did, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Don't laugh."              
\par   "Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and give me the            
\par nocturne over again. Look at that great honey-coloured moon that hangs      
\par in the dusky air. She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play      
\par she will come closer to the earth. You won't? Let us go to the club,        
\par then. It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly.        
\par There is some one at White's who wants immensely to know you- young         
\par Lord Poole, Bournemouth's eldest son. He has already copied your            
\par neckties, and has begged me to introduce him to you. He is quite            
\par delightful, and rather reminds me of you."                                  
\par   "I hope not," said Dorian, with a sad look in his eyes. "But I am         
\par tired to-night, Harry. I sha'n't go to the club. It is nearly               
\par eleven, and I want to go to bed early."                                     
\par   "Do stay. You have never played so well as to-night. There was            
\par something in your touch that was wonderful. It had more expression          
\par than I had ever heard from it before."                                      
\par   "It is because I am going to be good," he answered, smiling. "I am a      
\par little changed already."                                                    
\par   "You cannot change to me, Dorian," said Lord Henry. "You and I            
\par will always be friends."                                                    
\par   "Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that.         
\par Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It         
\par does harm."                                                                 
\par   "My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will soon be      
\par going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people          
\par against all the sins of which you have grown tired. You are much too        
\par delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You and I are what we         
\par are, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned by a book,          
\par there is no such thing as that. Art has no influence upon action. It        
\par annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books            
\par that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own          
\par shame. That is all. But we won't discuss literature. Come round             
\par to-morrow. I am going to ride at eleven. We might go together, and I        
\par will take you to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome. She is a             
\par charming woman, and wants to consult you about some tapestries she          
\par is thinking of buying. Mind you come. Or shall we lunch with our            
\par little Duchess? She says she never sees you now. Perhaps you are tired      
\par of Gladys? I thought you would be. Her clever tongue gets on one's          
\par nerves. Well, in any case, be here at eleven."                              
\par   "Must I really come, Harry?"                                              
\par   "Certainly. The Park is quite lovely now. I don't think there have        
\par been such lilacs since the year I met you."                                 
\par   "Very well. I shall be here at eleven," said Dorian. "Good-night,         
\par Harry." As he reached the door he hesitated for a moment, as if he had      
\par something more to say. Then he sighed and went out.                         
\par                                                                             
\par

\par -                                                                           
\par   It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his            
\par arm, and did not even put his silk scarf round his throat. As he            
\par strolled home, smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress        
\par passed him. He heard one of them whisper to the other, "That is Dorian      
\par Gray." He remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed          
\par out, or stared at, or talked about. He was tired of hearing his own         
\par name now. Half the charm of the little village where he had been so         
\par often lately was that no one knew who he was. He had often told the         
\par girl whom he had lured to love him that he was poor, and she had            
\par believed him. He had told her once that he was wicked, and she had          
\par laughed at him, and answered that wicked people were always very old        
\par and very ugly. What a laugh she had!- just like a thrush singing.           
\par And how pretty she had been in her cotton dresses and her large             
\par hats! She knew nothing, but she had everything that he had lost.            
\par   When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him. He         
\par sent him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library,         
\par and began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to      
\par him.                                                                        
\par   Was it really true that one could never change? He felt a wild            
\par longing for the unstained purity of his boyhood- his rose-white             
\par boyhood, as Lord Henry had once called it. He knew that he had              
\par tarnished himself, filled his mind with corruption and given horror to      
\par his fancy; that he had been an evil influence to others and had             
\par experienced a terrible joy in being so; and that of the lives that had      
\par crossed his own it had been the fairest and the most full of promise        
\par that he had brought to shame. But was it all irretrievable? Was             
\par there no hope for him?                                                      
\par   Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed         
\par that the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep           
\par the unsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due      
\par to that. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its           
\par sure, swift penalty along with it. There was purification in                
\par punishment. Not "Forgive us our sins" but "Smite us for our                 
\par iniquities" should be the prayer of man to a most just God.                 
\par   The curiously-carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so          
\par many years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed         
\par Cupids laughed round it as of old. He took it up, as he had done on         
\par that night of horror, when he had first noted the change in the             
\par fatal picture, and with wild tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished      
\par shield. Once, some one who had terribly loved him, had written to           
\par him a mad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: "The world is         
\par changed because you are made of ivory, and gold. The curves of your         
\par lips rewrite history." The phrases came back to his memory, and he          
\par repeated them over and over to himself. Then he loathed his own             
\par beauty, and flinging the mirror to the floor crushed it into silver         
\par splinters beneath his heel. It was his beauty that had ruined him, his      
\par beauty and the youth that he had prayed for. But for these two things,      
\par his life might have been free from stain. His beauty had been to him        
\par but a mask, his youth but a mockery. What was youth at best? A              
\par green, an unripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts.        
\par Why had he worn its livery? Youth had spoiled him.                          
\par   It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that. It      
\par was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think. James          
\par Vane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard. Alan Campbell      
\par had shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the      
\par secret that he had been forced to know. The excitement, such as it          
\par was, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away. It           
\par was already waning. He was perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it        
\par the death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind. It was         
\par the living death of his own soul that troubled him. Basil had               
\par painted the portrait that had marred his life. He could not forgive         
\par him that. It was the portrait that had done everything. Basil had said      
\par things to him that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with          
\par patience. The murder had been simply the madness of a moment. As for        
\par Alan Campbell, his suicide had been his own act. He had chosen to do        
\par it. It was nothing to him.                                                  
\par   A new life! That was what he wanted. That was what he was waiting         
\par for. Surely he had begun it already. He had spared one innocent thing,      
\par at any rate. He would never again tempt innocence. He would be good.        
\par   As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in      
\par the locked room had changed. Surely it was not still so horrible as it      
\par had been? Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel        
\par every sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps the signs of evil         
\par had already gone away. He would go and look.                                
\par   He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he unbarred        
\par the door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking         
\par face and lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes, he would be             
\par good, and the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be      
\par a terror to him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him            
\par already.                                                                    
\par   He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his               
\par custom, and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of          
\par pain and indignation broke from him. He could see no change, save that      
\par in the eyes there was a look of cunning, and in the mouth the curved        
\par wrinkle of the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome- more               
\par loathsome, if possible, than before- and the scarlet dew that               
\par spotted the hand seemed brighter, and more like blood newly spilt.          
\par Then he trembled. Had it been merely vanity that had made him do his        
\par one good deed? Or the desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had         
\par hinted, with his mocking laugh? Or that passion to act a part that          
\par sometimes makes us do things finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps,      
\par all these? And why was the red stain larger than it had been? It            
\par seemed to have crept like a horrible disease over the wrinkled              
\par fingers. There was blood on the painted feet, as though the thing           
\par had dripped- blood even on the hand that had not held the knife.            
\par Confess? Did it mean that he was to confess? To give himself up, and        
\par be put to death? He laughed. He felt that the idea was monstrous.           
\par Besides, even if he did confess, who would believe him? There was no        
\par trace of the murdered man anywhere. Everything belonging to him had         
\par been destroyed. He himself had burned what had been below-stairs.           
\par The world would simply say that he was mad. They would shut him up          
\par if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was his duty to confess, to         
\par suffer public shame, and to make public atonement. There was a God who      
\par called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well as to heaven.           
\par Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had told his own         
\par sin. His sin? He shrugged his shoulders. The death of Basil Hallward        
\par seemed very little to him. He was thinking of Hetty Merton. For it was      
\par an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he was looking at.           
\par Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing more in his            
\par renunciation than that? There had been something more. At least he          
\par thought so. But who could tell?... No. There had been nothing more.         
\par Through vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the mask of      
\par goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self. He          
\par recognized that now.                                                        
\par   But this murder- was it to dog him all his life? Was he always to be      
\par burdened by his past? Was he really to confess? Never. There was            
\par only one bit of evidence left against him. The picture itself- that         
\par was evidence. He would destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once it      
\par had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of late        
\par he had felt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night. When          
\par he had been away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes            
\par should look upon it. It had brought melancholy across his passions.         
\par Its mere memory had marred many moments of joy. It had been like            
\par conscience to him. Yes, it had been conscience. He would destroy it.        
\par   He looked round, and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil                 
\par Hallward. He had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left        
\par upon it. It was bright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter,        
\par so it would kill the painter's work, and all that that meant. It would      
\par kill the past, and when that was dead he would be free. It would            
\par kill this monstrous soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he         
\par would be at peace. He seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with        
\par it.                                                                         
\par   There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its        
\par agony that the frightened servants woke, and crept out of their rooms.      
\par Two gentlemen, who were passing in the Square below, stopped, and           
\par looked up at the great house. They walked on till they met a                
\par policeman, and brought him back. The man rang the bell several              
\par times, but there was no answer. Except for a light in one of the top        
\par windows, the house was all dark. After a time, he went away, and stood      
\par in an adjoining portico and watched.                                        
\par   "Whose house is that, constable?" asked the elder of the two              
\par gentlemen.                                                                  
\par   "Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir," answered the policeman.                         
\par   They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One          
\par of them was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.                                       
\par   Inside, in the servants' part of the house, the half-clad                 
\par domestics were talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf         
\par was crying, and wringing her hands. Francis was as pale as death.           
\par   After about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the      
\par footmen and crept upstairs. They knocked, but there was no reply. They      
\par called out. Everything was still. Finally, after vainly trying to           
\par force the door, they got on the roof, and dropped down on to the            
\par balcony. The windows yielded easily: their bolts were old.                  
\par   When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid            
\par portrait of their master as they had last seen him, in all the              
\par wonder of his exquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a          
\par dead man, in evening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was               
\par withered, wrinkled, and loathsome of visage. It was not till they           
\par had examined the rings that they recognized who it was.
